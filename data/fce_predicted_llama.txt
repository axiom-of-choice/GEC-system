Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am sad to hear that Richard is not at his best
I hope that he will soon recover and that he will be able to attend our conference.
As far as organization is concerned, an adequate number of double rooms with a shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace Hotel, located across the main street from the train station.
To get to our college, you can either walk down to the lakefront (about 10 minutes) or take the new cable car from the train station.
The college is just a few steps away from the bottom end
The end-of-conference party will take place on a boat that is cruising on the lake.
It will begin with a speech from the director of the conference, followed by a meal.
The recreational part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students, and it will end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am.
As nights may be cold at this time of year, may I suggest that you take with you a pullover.
As part of that, there is no recommendation as to what to wear.
Depending on the interests of your students, I would suggest that you visit the internet site of the tourist office at www.neuchatel.ch.
Yours sincerely
Where are you?
Is very often the first question that you will be asked when you answer the phone.
Why?
Because someone has invented the most popular communication device ever
The mobile phone
Once it's heavy, expensive, and not reliable, the new mobile phone fits in almost any pocket and is often given away by the operator to attract new customers
Due to the mobile phone signal.
Communication has changed, not improved.
Of course, it allows one to be reached everywhere, even in places you wouldn't want.
For rescue teams, it is a great help.
But isn't it a handicap outside professional life
 shouldn't people communicate with those they are next to, rather than calling someone two miles away.
It's not rare to see two people walking side by side, both talking on their phones.
Wouldn't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of calling home to ask which salad to buy
Mobile phones are a marvellous invention, but as for cigarettes, we should write them off
Caution: The use of this device may damage your brain.
Dear Mrs. Smith
I am writing to respond to your letter, which you wrote to me on 10 June.
Initially, I would like to inform you that the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located beside the Congress House in the city centre.
You can make contact with Mrs. Brackenbury by calling 08793 88888.
Secondly, the best way from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus, which is specially organized for us.
The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and returns to the hotel at 6:00 o'clock in the evening.
Of course, there's also a bus number 8 in front of the hotel that's also suitable, but it leaves only every half hour.
The end-of-conference party, which takes place in the evening on 20 June, will be held on the coast.
By the barbecue, there are some well-known student bands from our country performing music throughout the whole night.
What's more, is that there's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colorful
It plays from 10:00 to 11:00, while the students can enjoy it with dancing.
The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 at night
As you see, what to wear is just something casual.
Finally, in the last afternoon, we could visit the museums and markets (we have a very interesting robot-market).
Basically, it's a free time for the students to look around here by themselves.
I hope your questions are answered appropriately.
I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
Yours sincerely.
The computer life
Nowadays, computers can be found in almost every corner, in offices, and in shops.
Original text incorrect, corrected text: Even in cars and washing machines there are computer chips.
What impact has the computer had on our lives?
Firstly, the efficiency of the society has been improved.
When shopping, we don't need to wait at the cash register to take every item's receipt by hand.
When booking an airline, we can simply make a phone call to any agency, and get it done in one minute.
Secondly, instead of looking up tons of books to get the information we need, we can very easily search for it on the internet or on the local network.
It's a very often-heard statement that someone who has a special illness gets operations from foreign institutions, which he finds via the internet.
Moreover, with a computer network, it can be possible for people to work from home, make projects, control operations, or have conferences.
Lastly, the way of communication has also changed.
Instead of traditional telecommunications, we can talk, mail, or even see each other with the help of a computer network.
Of course, there are also some aspects in which computer technology needs to be improved.
For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as it is on paper.
A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security of
Until now, it's still somehow not safe enough to completely rely on computers.
In conclusion, computers have become a very essential necessity of our life, and it's still a young invention that needs to be improved.
Dear Maria,
First of all, I am sorry about Richard's illness.
Please remind him of me and give him my best wishes.
About your request, I'm happy to provide you with all the information that I think you may need; however, you can always call me if you consider it necessary. My phone number is 2496-9731.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel.
Because it is a well-known hotel, it should be easy to find it.
Moreover, it is really well located, so it will allow you to move around the city without any problems.
Even more, the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre, which is located just a five-minute walk from the Hotel.
We haven't asked for any special clothes, so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes; although you can come well-dressed, if you feel better.
After the conference, we are going to have an informal dinner with some previous snacks in order to introduce each other.
In my opinion, finally, you should visit the Art Gallery.
It will take you two or three hours, but it's a gorgeous place.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely.
Sagrada Família is a truly holy building.
If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona, which, regardless of your tastes, you will likely enjoy, you should visit the 'Sagrada Familia'.
Among the numerous choices, this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view from the top of its towers, a charming story, and one of the most representative examples of Catalan modernisme architecture.
Gaudi conceived this church in 1912, though it wasn't until 1920 that they started to build it.
Since the beginning, the work was interrupted at different periods and started again.
After Gaudí's death, it was crucially important to stop, which was fortunately solved three years later.
Nowadays, a lot of hard work is being done in an effort to finish as quickly as possible.
The visitor can wander around all the buildings or follow a guided tour.
There is an exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted.
And, unless you suffer from heart problems, you should climb the 350 steps that carry you to the top.
There, you can enjoy a terrific view. Not only will you see almost all the city, but also you will discover another perspective of this magnificent building.
Dear Ms. Smith
As you know, I am in charge of organizing the conference at my college. Do not worry if Richard did not leave you all the information.
I am pleased to help you.
We looked in every hotel in town trying to give you the best offers
We found two good hotels, but we decided on the Palace Hotel
This has the best price that we could find.
At our school, the driver is going to pick you up from the hotel and take you to the conference.
The party is going to be held at a local discotheque near the college, so the best way to get there is by walking.
You don't have to wear any special kind of clothes, but in my opinion, you can wear very casual.
Finally, the last day, I suggest you go to the mall, where you can enjoy shopping and looking around.
Yours sincerely,
Introduction.
The aim of this report is to recommend that you visit the Fuerte de San Diego Museum.
This is a historic building.
I asked some people in town, and this was the best place to choose.
History
The Fuerte de San Diego Museum was built at a time when the Spanish were trying to take all the land from Mexico. One of the most important people who was at the forefront of the Fuerte was Hernán Cortés, the first Spanish conquistador to have gained more lands than anyone at that time.
The place
The Museum is situated in front of the sea, in the centre of Acapulco.
It is situated at the top of a little mountain in the 'old' part of the city.
You can get there by car or on foot, and you'll be able to see everything that was made at that time.
In conclusion
On the whole, this is the best building in Acapulco for its history and reputation.
Is it the best place to visit and easy to get to?
Dear Ms. Maria Smith
As the leader of the conference, I am glad if I can help you.
My wish is that nothing go wrong
So, you need to know more details about our conference
Your hotel is called the Palace Hotel and it is located in the city centre.
As far as I know, this hotel is very comfortable.
There is also a subway station near Palace Hotel.
Our college is not very far away.
You only have to take the subway or train.
After three stations, you have arrived on Brooklyn Street.
When you come out of the subway, you see our college
The conference starts at 6 o'clock and ends at 8:00 o'clock
The students have prepared a music programme for the end of conference party.
There will also be an international buffet.
So don't eat too much before you come
And please don’t worry about clothes.
There is no rule.
In our city, there is a big adventure swimming park.
I think you should visit Water World on your last day.
You will have a lot of fun; I can tell you.
If you need any further information, please call me.
My number is 793354
Sincerely
The telephone is a very important invention that has affected our lives.
It's a way for people to communicate, although they are at two different places.
People use the telephone every day, and it is one of the most important things in daily life.
In my opinion, people need a telephone.
For example, a telephone is very important in both job and life.
Nowadays, there are no companies that do not have a telephone.
It is also good for people's safety.
You can call the police if you're in danger, or an ambulance if you're injured.
The people also use the telephone for their personal lives.
For example, when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away.
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone.
They are able to give and receive information very quickly
This invention has made our lives easier and quicker
The telephone has made my life both easy and quick.
It makes something possible that you cannot do.
Finally, I would say that the telephone is very efficient for everyone.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am writing to reply to your letter and to provide answers to your questions
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, a five-star hotel, that offers many facilities.
It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable room.
The students can get there by taking the number 35 bus.
They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off at Palace Station after five stops.
The hotel is opposite the station.
At the end of the conference, the college, in which the conference is to be held, gives a party for all the students.
It will be offered light food, like sandwiches, pommes frites, chips, sweets, and different drinks – no alcohol.
There will be live music, and the students are able to dance and enjoy themselves.
It would be better to wear casual clothes, because they are more comfortable and are liked by students.
On the last day, the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city, which can be arranged if the students want to.
The group can also visit the zoo, the opera, or stay and relax at the college's enormous garden and enjoy its settings.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you require further information.
I am looking forward to seeing you;
Sincerely,
To the Group Leader of American students

The subject is an interesting building to visit
Here is information about the castle in Nuremberg
Location: The castle is located in the city centre near a large, enormous church.
Someone can get to the city centre using the No. 456 bus, and then walk to the castle.
It is over 100 years old, but it is kept in a good condition by the local people, who are proud of this castle.
Activities: At this time of year, you will visit Nuremberg, where many theatrical plays or concerts take place.
View: From the castle, you can have a wonderful view of all the town, especially at night when all the lights are on.
It is a different experience.
History: At the castle, there are always a few guides, who will show someone around and tell them about the history of the castle – when it was built, by whom, and why – which makes everyone enthusiastic.
Recommendation
I recommend visiting this castle, because it is interesting, marvelous, and something different.
It is the favorite place of all the tourists who visit Nuremberg.
Nuremberg is also famous for this castle and the students will have a different experience and a lesson, too.
By the way, you can visit the
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am writing in response to your latest letter regarding the international student conference at our college.
I'd be happy to provide you with the information that's been requested
First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group.
This hotel is quiet and near the conference building.
However, I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transportation.
Furthermore, as usual, we would organize a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students were to wear a suit for men or a skirt for women.
Furthermore, this party would be held in your hotel, as were the following years.
Finally, there are a lot of museums in our town; therefore, I would suggest going to the frog's museum, which is really fascinating.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you need any further information.
Yours sincerely
From:
For the group leader.
Subject: The Aboriginal Art Museum.
The aim of this report is intended to describe the largest building in our town.
I am in a position to choose a good building that students like me are interested in.
This museum presents more than 20,000 original art pieces.
b) The building has been built in 1999, therefore, it is a modern architectural structure.
c ) This building is as high as the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
d) This building is included: 30 toilets, 500,000 lights, and also 100 people who can help you if you need any information.
I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the oldest civilization of the world in one of the most modern buildings
Mrs. Smith,
I received your letter this morning, and I would like to thank you for your interest in the conference.
I hope I can answer your questions.
At first, this international student conference has the intention of explaining to students just how important education is.
In addition to this, we choose the luxury Palace Hotel, which is comfortable enough and located in a good location.
The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city. So, you can go by train, by bus, or by car.
I suggest that you go by train or get off at the Museum Station.
The conference will happen at the hotel, which is so much easier.
The conference, not being modest, is a quite well-organized one.
It will start at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon.
I suggest that you wear something informal.
Even though we want to make things as comfortable as possible for our students
I am very happy that you want to know my area; although I am afraid an afternoon isn’t enough.
However, if you want, you can call me, and I can show you some interesting places. I'll be very glad.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Affecting Our Lives
Cars, boats, motorbikes, and airplanes: Who has never used this one?
That's a good question.
Humans seem to always think they are running, and the fastest of all this invention's is certainly the airplane.
At first, when Santos Dumont invented the airplane, he probably didn't think about how the people could transform his creation.
In this world, where the nations fight to be the best one couldn't be more different: the airplane became the most important thing in the war.
Unfortunately, it was used to kill a large number of people.
However, the invention of the airplane has brought us many facilities.
How could someone from Brazil travel to Australia?
Maybe by boat, but it could take too long.
The best way is definitely by air.
After this invention, traveling around the world is so much easier.
Now, we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented facilities for us.
So, the airplane is definitely an important invention, because it has changed people's lives in wars.
Until now, it has been important in the transportation of thousands and thousands of people around the world.
Let's congratulate Santos Dumont!
Dear Mrs. Smith
Thank you for your letter.
Of course, I will give you some more detail about the student conference.
First of all, the hotel that Richard Brown has been locked into is the Palace Hotel
Its is located close to the main train station in our town.
It's quite near the conference building.
There will be extras to get there.
The bus will pick you up right at your hotel entry
The end-of-conference party will be a small dinner for all the students
You don't have to wear special clothes, just wear what you always wear.
If you take your uniform with you, it would be pleasant to leave it at the hotel and wear something else.
There are many things you could do during this short time on the last day.
You could visit our famous Museum of Art, or go for a walk along the lake.
If you're looking for something to do for fun or entertainment, go bowling.
If you have any further questions, just let me know
Sincerely yours
Our church is a very famous building in our country.
It is eighty metres long and its tower is forty-five metres high.
On the top of the tower, it has a huge clock on each side.
The tower is red, and the church itself is white-painted
In the church are many expensive drawers
There is space for about five hundred people.
The church was built in 1385.
It was rebuilt in 1948 because of the Second World War, which had been damaged.
The church is located at a place where you can see the whole mountain chain of Rigi.
Visit our church because it is one of the most famous churches in our country.
It has an interesting past.
The tower is absolutely marvelous.
You can walk to the top of the tower, and it shows you a beautiful view.
If you want to visit the church, there will be a special guide who will show you all the things and answer your questions.
The entry will be free
Dear Mrs. Smith, Hello Maria.
In this letter, you will receive all the information you need.
The hotel that the group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel, located in Victoria Road.
And you can take the bus in front of the hotel to get to the college.
It's four bus stops
Then walk straight for five minutes, and you will see the college.
After the party, we will go to an entertainment area to have fun, and we will eat at McDonald's.
The rest you already know.
I suggest wearing shirts and jeans
And the last three hours before you return, we can go to the 'Imax' cinema to watch a 3-D film.
After we eat at the KFC.
Then we'll take you and the students to the airport.
That's all.
I am waiting for you.
Your sincerely
Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places.
But the best place for me is "La Veguada".
An entertainment and commercial building
In there, students can have fun in the recreation areas; they can watch a film, eat all kinds of food, and go shopping.
We can have fun too.
And that's why I recommend this place to you.
The building itself is a large one.
It is very safe because there are policemen and cameras.
The buildings seem to be very new, but it is quite old.
People love this place, which is often referred to as 'Madrid'.
Around it, there are many restaurants and shops that the building brings a lot of people.
Inside, there are fast-food restaurants and shops as well.
And it's easy to come
Just take the bus number 83 or take the subway.
Here, you can find everything that you want.
I hope you like it.
12 June 2001
Dear Ms. Smith,
I received your letter, and I'm happy to help you. We booked the Palace Hotel for your group; it's nice and quiet.
I'm sure you'll be fine here.
We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too.
So, you're going to arrive at the conference in a few minutes.
When you leave the hotel, turn right and go straight on. At the first crossroads, turn right again.
At the end of this street, you can see our college on your left; it's a green building.
At the end of the conference party, it will be something to eat and to drink
In the big room where we will have the party, it will be some pictures of our college; you will see all the generations who have passed here.
The wearers aren't very important, but it will be fine if the people will wear something different from the usual jeans.
Here, we have a lot of beautiful things to do; however, the best you can do in about three hours is visiting the painting museum.
We're all looking forward to seeing your group.
Yours sincerely,
Television
What would our world be like without television?
It isn't easy giving an answer to this question.
Television is an important invention. It permitted us to better our way of communicating.
This animated box can provide us with a lot of information coming from all around the world.
Television has affected our daily lives, too. We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs; all we have to do is watch.
And we like that, because it's easier to do nothing than to engage ourselves in something that makes us do something.
So, television can be both a positive and a negative invention; it depends on how one chooses to use this box.
Now we should be able to answer the introducing question.
No, I don't think so.
Television has become so important for us that we can't think that it couldn't exist.
Dear Ms. Smith
I am writing to answer your letter about the details of an international students' conference
Palace Hotel has been booked. You should first walk from the hotel to the Town Hall railway station, which is on the North City Line, a yellow line on the map.
After getting on the train, you should get off at the Mountain station, which is 20 minutes away and is located in front of the conference.
The conference, to be held from 1 pm to 4 pm, is a formal event.
You should wear formal clothes, and you're going to play a game and enjoy a welcome drink together.
Before catching our plane, we will have three hours to enjoy shopping around the airport in the afternoon.
Because there are so many unique shops, you should buy good gifts for your parents.
Yours sincerely,
Dear Mr. Wolf
I am writing to answer your question about the interesting building you want to visit.
I would like to introduce one building in my town.
Sky Heaven
This building has a hundred floors, and it takes about five minutes from the ground to the top in the elevator.
There are many facilities that include a museum, an exhibition, and numerous gift shops where we might also enjoy shopping.
The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the highest building in the world.
You should get to the top of the building and experience such an amazing view.
Another reason is that there is a good museum, which tells you about the history of my town so easily and clearly.
It's a good experience for your students.
I hope you will accept my recommendation, and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely yours,
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I'm glad to help you organize the international student conference.
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube. The building of the conference is then just five minutes away on foot.
At the end of the conference, there is a party, where we can eat something, dance, and speak to each other about the conference.
For the party, I suggest you wear classic clothes; perhaps something black and not red or pink. I am going to wear black classic trousers and a white jersey – it can be that this information will give you some idea too.
On the last day, we're going to have about three hours of free time.
What do you think about visiting the Arts Museum?
If we are willing to go, we can attend a classic concert near the conference building's.
I hope that I've been able to give you some help.
And I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
Sincerely yours
Dear Morgan,
I am writing a report, which will describe the most important building in my town.
The most important building in Biasco is the Casa Cavalier Pellanda.
It is an old, large house belonging to a rich lord in the middle of the town.
In this house, there is a big museum, where you can learn about the past of Biasco.
Underneath the museum, there is a big dark space where the wine is produced.
Your American students could learn how the Mérit/Tiencin 'is produced and why it's so famous in Tian.
I think that these suggestions could interest your student, then Biasco, with its Casa Cavalier Pellanda, is the middle point between two valleys - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle point between two similar, but also different, cultures too.
I hope that this information will bring you to visit Biasco and its house.
Yours faithfully,
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown isn't well and hope he'll get better soon. I am more than happy to give you the necessary information.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is only two miles away from our college.
The college will arrange a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive at the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15.
The reason we don't suggest taking a walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site, which isn't going to be suitable for a group of 20 students.
As you already know, we are going to have the end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the beginning, then it will be a buffet and a disco.
You don't need to dress up smartly, but please make sure that your students don't wear shorts or trainers.
Regarding what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave, I would suggest taking the students to our History Museum.
It's not very big, but it has got some amazing information about the history of our town and its people.
There is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
I hope I've answered all your questions, but if you need any more information, please let me know.
I am looking forward to seeing you all soon.
Best regards,
In my personal opinion, one of the most important and useful things that have been invented is a car.
Cars play a big part in our lives
Everywhere you look, you can see cars.
More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time compared to travelling by public transport.
Cars are also more reliable than other types of transportation
You don't have to wait at a bus stop on a cold and windy day for a late bus, or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs, you can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a pleasant drive to your destination.
Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as fires in a house, or if someone is critically ill.
Could you imagine if our police, doctors, or firefighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot?
I don't think I need to comment on this.
From my personal experience, I realized how important it is to drive a car when I was living in Johannesburg, South Africa.
I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only four months old, and I couldn't drive at that time.
Johannesburg is a very dangerous place to live
I couldn't just go for a walk; it was too dangerous.
There was no public transport, and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time. And I relied on other people to take me to a shop, the doctor's, or anywhere else.
I soon realized that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and me.
Since I passed my driving test, I can understand how I used to live without a car before.
I use my car every day, everywhere I go, and I absolutely love it!
June 12, 2001
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am writing to inform you of some information about an international student conference
First of all, the hotel in which the group has been booked is called The Princes Hotel.
It is very near York Railway Station, which you can easily get to.
If you're taking the train, get off at York station and you can walk from there. Turn left, and the hotel will be on your left-hand side.
By bus, most of the buses in York City Centre pass the station, or you can take a taxi.
Secondly, the conference is an important event for all of us; we agree to wear formal attire.
For example, men should wear suits, ties, and so on.
In addition, at the end of the conference party, we also have a country dancing show
It could be very special because all the dancers are from our own group.
Finally, on the last day, we have an afternoon free.
It would be great if we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings.
If you could think of any other ideas, it would be very kind of you. I would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Inventions have affected all our lives.
Nowadays, a lot of things are invented and make our lives more convenient than they were in those days.
A car is one of the most useful inventions.
I think a car is very important to me because it's very convenient for everyday use
For example, I can travel to many places in the UK. Especially, I live in Whitwell-on-the-Hill, a village near Malton in North Yorkshire.
Can you imagine what would happen if I hadn't had a car? How could I go shopping, go to college, and so on?
In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go past my village, but the bus fare is very expensive for me.
Apart from that, it takes a long time to get somewhere.
The car has had a large impact on my own life
I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than using public transportation
I can listen to the radio, and sometimes I can listen to Thai music, which I brought some cassette tapes with me from Thailand.
I took a car-driving theory test last October, and I passed it; I will take a practice driving test very soon.
I think I need to drive the car myself, so that I will get to know its advantages by using it.
In conclusion, I think cars are very important to me, and it has had an impact on my own life.
If I had more money, I would buy another car. I think it has more advantages than disadvantages.
So, we should say many thanks to the person who invented a car.
Dear Mrs. Smith
It was such a pleasure to receive your letter, and we will be extremely glad to see you at the conference; we have been organizing.
Let me give you some further information about the event.
Firstly, I would like to inform you that the hotel we have already booked is for your use.
Called the Palace Hotel, we hope that it will satisfy your expectations.
The conference isn't too far from your hotel
I strongly recommend that you use the public transportation in order to get there, because you may find other types of transportation quite expensive.
Moreover, you must be aware of the fact that the conference is going to last for two hours until 10:00 pm.
After that, our college has organized a barbecue night, with traditional local music that you should not miss.
You don't need to wear formal clothing.
Just everyday clothes
Finally, I am aware of the fact that on the last day you have some hours free before you catch your plane.
Don't miss the chance to visit our famous tourist attractions
There is also a huge shopping centre, where you can buy some souvenirs or taste some of our traditional foods.
I hope that you will find my information helpful
I'm looking forward to seeing you

THE HISTORICAL MUSEUM
Welcome to Athens!
Without any doubt, a historical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passage of centuries.
Don't miss the historical museum, located in the heart of the capital city.
A traditional building that was built at the beginning of the century.
The historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what Greeks have always considered to be their main principle: their freedom.
There are five different floors, each presenting a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
The museum provides visitors with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing, famous paintings having as their main subject the revolution of 1821, and aspects of Greek religion that are considered a vital part of Greek history.
Visitors are expected to pay a small amount for entry
Inside the museum, there is a bookstore with a large variety of historical books, maps, etc.
If you really want to discover what Greek history means, we strongly recommend that you visit the historical museum!
Dear Maria Smith,
Thank you for your letter; I will try to help you.
I will remind you that the international student conference is scheduled to take place next month, on the first of July.
The hotel that we booked was the Palace Hotel, which is near the bus station.
When you are at the bus station, you will catch bus number 37, which will go to the town centre.
From there, you will walk until you reach the college, as it's easier to get there than to take another bus.
Anyway, the college is the first road on your right, from the town centre.
After the conference, some drink and food will be available in the sports center, which is well equipped for a disco party.
Our party has a special interest in Western.
So we suggest that you wear Western clothing.
On your last day, you could go to the museum of sports, which is grateful and famous around the world, or simply take a walk around Reconvillier Park.
I hope that I have answered all of your questions and that the conference will be grateful.
Sincerely yours
From
To the group leader
The subject is the old Roman School.
Introduction: I am writing to explain the location, the architecture, and the story of the old Roman school from Courtelary. I hope that you will get there with your group because it has a lot of beautiful things to see.
It is the unique, old Roman school in the world
Location: Courtelary is situated in Switzerland, and the school is located at the top of the town's hill.
This place is very important because it is where an emperor grew up.
Architecture: It is a characteristic feature of this era, with beautiful artwork on the walls and early forms of writing in the sports centre.
The door is enormous because their entry was the most important.
History: All began when Ogus Micius said that Romans need to go to school.
They decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland, because the people were considered clever
During the Second World War, all schools were demolished; only one is left.
I conclude that I gave you a lot of reasons to enter this building, and I hope you will enjoy your trip in my town.
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
Thank you for your letter;
I am writing to answer your questions.
Firstly, I have already booked the Palace Hotel for the students.
There is a hotel near my college
It takes about five minutes to walk to my college.
I will copy the map around the campus.
Secondly, I will tell you about the end-of-conference party.
It will start at 6 o'clock
The party will be held in the dining room.
People who will attend the party are many professors, semi-professors, and faculty members.
So, I suggest that the students should wear formal clothing.
Finally, I will give you some ideas for your afternoon's free time.
The city in which my college is located is traditional in my country
For example, there are many shrines, temples, and castles.
I suggest that you visit these places.
You will have a good time.
In addition, there are many other colleges.
You will be able to see many Japanese students.
I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
If you would like to gain more information, you will ask me every time.
Yours sincerely.
I suggest that you visit one building.
My town is not the capital of Japan.
So, there are many higher buildings.
I think it's like New York City.
However, I have only one building that I want you to visit.
The name of the building is 'Sunshine 60'.
This is the highest building in Tokyo. I recommend visiting.
I have three reasons for my recommendation.
Firstly, there is an aquarium in the building.
In addition, this is the 60th floor. I went there for the first time; I couldn't believe it.
Furthermore, if you visit there, you will see everything in Tokyo.
The scenery in Tokyo is not beautiful, but you might think that this city is a developing one.
On the other hand, you might think that such a small city is.
Finally, there are many shops inside the building. You will have a good time for shopping.
I hope that when you visit, you will see my favourite place.
You should visit there.
June 12, 2001
Dear Ms. Smith, Thank you for your letter inquiring about my help at the conference.
I would like to help you with my best efforts
Firstly, Palace Hotel has been booked for the group's accommodation, and I spoke with the hotel manager before traveling to the conference.
The hotel has its own buses; it will pick us up from the hotel to the conference salon.
Secondly, I would like to tell more about the end-of-conference party. I booked the Palace Hotel's restaurant for our party, and it is big enough for your students.
It's going to be very lovely and enjoyable, because I have lots of surprises in store for the students.
In addition, I suggest that they should wear clothes that are both sporty and comfortable.
Finally, you would like to know some activities for your three hours of free time.
I think you can go to 'Dreamland'.
In this place, there are video games, some little competitions, and a small zoo available.
Students can enjoy their time in this place, and it's on the way to the airport.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely, Your
To the American students' group leader
From...
Regarding: Information about an interesting building to visit
Introduction.
Here is my report for American students who are interested in learning about an interesting building to visit in Ankara.
I would like to describe 'Akbar's Mausoleum'. Note: Anitkabir is the correct name, but as it seems to be a misspelling, I have suggested the full name of the monument. It is not an abbreviation that needs to be written in quotation marks.
Findings
1. This building's name is 'Anıtkabir' and it is the largest building in Ankara.
It was built in 1953.
It is situated in the middle of the forest.
There are different kinds of birds and different kinds of trees present.
nan
It has a very big museum inside the building, and all of the buildings are made from stone.
3. These building's security guards are very special soldiers.
Their aim is to protect the building from the enemy, because there is also a very big army museum available.
 Sentence.
It has no charge for entrance, and it has a good view for tourists to see Ankara from the hill
It is open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm
Recommendations.
I recommend that it is the best building to visit in Ankara, because it includes all Turkish history and offers very good sightseeing.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am writing in reply to your letter about the international student conference
The hotel that we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel
It's not far from our college; the drive takes about 20 minutes by car.
It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total number of your group is four, and taxi fare would not be expensive.
There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel.
Regarding the end-of-conference party on Thursday, it will start at 7:00 p.m. in the garden of the college.
You can wear either casual dresses or fancy ones because we have a fancy-dress competition, and the raffle prize is a bottle of French champagne.
On Friday afternoon, it looks like it's going to be a free time.
Therefore, you can go shopping in the town centre, which is near the college.
Many beautiful and traditional souvenirs can be found there.
The other suggestion is going to the flower market, which is very famous among tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy.
Moreover, it is the largest flower market in this area.
I look forward to meeting you soon; I hope your journey is safe.
Yours sincerely.
Invented Light
There are many sources of light in this world, such as sunlight, moonlight, and candlelight.
Some of them are natural, whereas the others are not.
Owing to the increasing demand for more light, the natural source is not adequate.
There, electric lighting has been invented.
Nowadays, the electric light has become a part of our lives, especially at night.
Whatever we do at night, we need the electric light.
Have you ever imagined how this world would be if there were no electric lights?
It must have had a significant impact on industry, agriculture, and our lifestyle.
Think about when the electricity in your house had a short circuit
Do you feel uncomfortable.
Could you do much of anything without light?
In addition, the electric light is a manuscript for many other electric equipment; it has become an important part of our life, too.
I think we should be grateful that we have the electric light, which comforts our lifestyle
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I was very pleased to receive your letter.
It is my pleasure to help you organize the international student conference.
Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located in the town centre.
Students can take the airport bus to the hotel directly upon your arrival.
And the best way to get from there to the conference is to buy a coach, as there are about 35 international students; they are all strangers here.
It's therefore no good taking a bus.
I'll be happy to help you book the coach
Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held at the college's main hall, at 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on the 20th of June.
There will be various kinds of food and drink provided.
Moreover, students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music, for instance, rock, jazz, pop, garage, and so on.
Furthermore, I suggest that you and the students wearing pub wear go there, as it is suitable for dancing.
Finally, on the last day, I suggest that you could go to the market in town during the three-hour gap.
It is a nice place to buy British-style gifts for your family and friends.
You could also enjoy the tea at the cafes nearby.
I would be grateful to help in any way if you need it.
I am looking forward to seeing you.
Yours sincerely,
From: Genevieve Chiu
To the group leader of American students
A fascinating subject: interesting buildings to visit in Hong Kong
Visiting the Po Lin Temple
The purpose of this is to provide information to American students about Po Lin Temple, which is worth visiting.
There is no sentence to correct.
A brief history of Po Lin Temple:
It was found in 1910.
It is a traditional type of Chinese temples
Because of the Second World War, it was rebuilt in 1960 
A big Buddha was built in 1997, just next to the temple, which is the largest outdoor Buddha in the world.
Sentence 2: Location.
The location of Po Lin Temple is on Lotus Island, which is the second-biggest island in Hong Kong.
nan
Opening and closing times:
Po Lin Temple is open to the public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Mondays to Fridays, and from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturdays and Sundays.
Four. Transports.
You could take the MTR (Hong Kong's underground) straight to Lotus Island, or take a ferry to get there.
Then, you need to take the bus (A110, A111, or A112) to Po Lin Temple.
It's quite convenient.
All the buses and the MTR have air conditioning.
nan
Attractive points.
You could go sightseeing around the temple and take photos.
Of course, you may gain more knowledge about Hong Kong, as the temples have been here for nearly 100 years.
The well-known Big Buddha; you mustn’t miss it, or you will be sorry.
The temple also provides free Chinese traditional-style meals for visitors
Sentence:
In conclusion
To sum up, I think Po Lin Temple is a nice place to visit, especially for American students.
Easy to get there is free admission.
On the other hand, Hong Kong is known as a highly commercial city, but you could find something different at Po Lin Temple.
Dear Ms. Smith,
First of all, I'm sorry to hear that Richard Brown is ill.
As you are the leader of a group rather than him, I'm delighted to give all the information you've asked for.
The Palace Hotel has been booked for the group, and from there to the conference, we have organized with the hotel's bus service to take the students to the conference.
We will meet at the lobby at 9:00 a.m.
The conference party will last until 1:00 AM, but everyone doesn't need to stay until the end.
There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay until the end of the party.
The bus will be serviced at 9:30 PM and 11:30 PM, and then at the end of the party, it will be the last one.
Everybody is free to dress for the party, but they should consider being appropriate.
On the last day, at noon, you could go to the craft centre nearby the airport.
There are lots of things there that you will enjoy watching or buying for friends.
If there's any information you need to know about the conference, please let me know.
I look forward to seeing you at the conference.
Sincerely yours,
The telephone saved my friendship
It's very hard to decide which invention is the best.
Because all of them are so important in different ways
As I'm currently away from home, the telephone is very important to me.
Having a telephone, I can call my mother and my friends who are helping me from home while I'm sick. It's not completely ideal, but I think it's better than other ways.
To hear the voice from the person you love is a feeling that's hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. You can imagine their face clearly.
I had a problem with my best friend once, when we kept in touch through email.
The problem was the language; we used English, but we both weren't very good at it by then, which made us misunderstand each other.
However, the problem was solved by a telephone.
We are now still friends.
Thanks to the invention of the telephone.
Dear Mrs. Smith
With reference to the information that you had requested, the hotel that had been booked is the Holiday Inn, in Newport and to get to the University of Wales, which is not far from the hotel, you only need to take a diversion where clearly indicated Carleon; once on the main road, all you need to do is follow the country road, which takes you directly to the place.
Regarding the party at the end of the conference, this will be a formal affair, therefore you will need formal clothing as you know there will be company directors, managers, etc.
As for the last day, I would suggest taking a visit to the local museum and the ruins' Castle.
In the first you will find a very interesting collection of Roman vestiges; also, you can visit another section, which is supposed to be a Roman site.
Yours sincerely
I have always felt very lucky to have been born in the 20th century because of all the amazing human inventions.
As an example, let's have a look and we'll see how this nation has developed.
We just need to think about the first world-wide and all the inventions created thanks to the industrial revolution to this day.
However, I feel that at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because industrial pollution, which has been created, seems to be very little that has been done so far in relation to our environment.
I hope that in the future, there will be even more people interested in this important issue.
Dear Ms. Maria Smith,
I read your letters, and I'm ready to help you.
I think that we need to decide which hotel is best for the students.
I have an idea, and I think you will agree with me.
I was thinking about the Palace Hotel because it is very nice and cheap.
It has comfortable bedrooms and a place for parties
You can book this hotel; it's the best, and it's near the conference – it's just a 15-minute walk.
I think that it would be nice at the end-of-conference party if you were to invite someone to sing and give the students the time to enjoy themselves and to dance.
The party will be nice.
The clothes have to be smart, not if you're going to a casino, for example, but nice and casual, not with sports shoes or T-shirts.
On the last day of the afternoon, when you have three hours free, you can go for coffee or to visit some places.
Those are my ideas for the conference.
I hope that you will like it.
Sincerely
Today, our article will be about some inventions that we need in our life
I think that all these things we need in our life because they can give us a lot of things.
First of all, we need the telephone in our house because it's important to make a call if you need something, or if something has happened to your house, and nobody is next to you.
The second one is a lamp; the electricity is very important in our life.
In the past, the people didn't have electricity; and if they wanted, for example, to read or to cook something, they used to do it in the fire.
It's important to have electricity because without it, you can't do anything.
The other one is a television.
You must have TV because you can listen to what's happening in the world, and you can watch some places that you didn't get to.
You can enjoy your time watching a film, if you have free time.
The boat isn't so important, but you can use it for fishing and to see some places.
The car is now very important in our lives. You can go wherever you want.
This year, the family has three cars: one for each member.
For me, the most important thing is the telephone because without it, you can't do anything; it's part of my life.
Dear Ms. Smith,
First of all, the group has been booked at the Palace Hotel.
It's a big hotel because there will be lots of people
It has a swimming pool and a nice bar.
The hotel is ten minutes away from the conference, and a bus will be available to take us directly there.
At the end of the conference, there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant, so people must wear nice clothes; jeans are not allowed.
Next to the restaurant, there is a disco for people who like dancing.
We can do a lot of things in my area.
We have the possibility to visit the old town; it's very nice, and there are a lot of shops.
We can visit the old castle or the painting museum too.
I consider television to be the most important invention.
I think it's good for old people because some of them cannot go to the cinema anymore
In one hand, it's because they haven't got enough money to pay it, and in the other hand, it's because they can't move very well, for example, if they are disabled.
With television, old people are less alone because most older women do not have their husbands anymore
Television is a good way to stay informed about the news
I prefer being informed by television to being informed by newspapers; it's more relaxing.
I think television is a good invention for children when they have free time, and while they're watching television, we don't have to look after them if we have something important to do.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I'm very glad to be able to help you out with such a situation.
First of all, the group has been booked into 'The Palace Hotel'.
You won't have any problem finding the college because it's in front of the hotel, and the conference will be held there.
As you know, the conference will start at 11:00 and will finish at 13:00; however, we will have lunch altogether at 13:30 in the college's hall until 14:30.
You'll have to wear a white shirt and blue trousers if you want to be able to wear a blue jacket.
When we had finished, you'll be able to enjoy yourself in our cinema or television room. But if you prefer other things, we've got a swimming pool and a library; it's entirely up to you.
I hope it was useful for you.
Sincerely yours,
Dear Group Leader,
In accordance with your request, I'm going to give you some information about what's considered the best place to visit in this town, Fuengirola.
Fuengirola has a wonderful and beautiful castle, situated right on the seafront.
It is placed at the top of a little hill that is part of the beach
You can't lose the chance to see this castle because it's an excellent view, and there are always a lot of people there, as well as little shops where you can buy souvenirs.
At the same time, you can enjoy the castle, take a break to go to the beach, and look at the castle from the sea; it's also amazing.
Also, there is a museum of history inside.
As you see, you have to visit the castle; you won't feel any regret about that.
Sincerely
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am writing to answer your letter, where you asked for information about the conferences and other points in relation.
The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel.
It's a very nice hotel in the centre of the city, and it's very close to the college where the conference is being held, just a five-minute walk.
Walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or bus.
When you arrive at the colleges, there will be people indicating the way to the conference room
At the end of the conference, we're having a party with some cold goodies and some drinks.
There will be music as well for dancing.
The director of the college has suggested wearing smart clothes for that occasion, and I give you the same advice.
Before I leave in the afternoon, I have some suggestions.
In the hotel's vicinity or surrounding area, there are two interesting places to visit.
One is the Picasso museum, and the other is an important gallery where you can enjoy seeing different kinds of paintings.
I hope my information can help you, and it has been useful.
I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
Yours sincerely,
I think that there is an invention that has been very important: the computer.
The computer is very useful, and it has affected our own lives, in different ways.
The computer has done a lot of work.
For works that you need, for example, you can do them in ten minutes; the same!
But computers haven't had an overall positive impact, thanks to computers, as the number of workplaces for individuals remains relatively small.
But, definitely, they have been a very important invention.
The latest one related to computers is the internet .
By internet, you can communicate with people from different parts of the world at the same moment.
And you can take lots of information about a lot of things.
Everything you need you can find on the internet
Nowadays, computers are very developed and this trend is increasing
What will be the next thing?
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
I have received your letter, and I am glad I can help.
You have been booked to stay at the Palace Hotel, which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here.
The best way to get here is once you've left the hotel, turn right and follow the signs to the hospital, because it's just by our college.
When you're on campus, ask for me.
The conference will take one hour, and at 8 o'clock the party will start; it is a formal party, and you should wear formal attire.
The dress code is no jeans.
We will provide you with food and drinks.
I have quite a few ideas for your free hours
There are lots of things to do here.
We have a museum that is just two minutes from your hotel.
You can also go to a nearby park and eat something at the café.
If you go to the main street, you will find a street full of shops, and I'm sure the students would like that.
I hope this information is helpful.
If you have any other questions, please, do not hesitate to contact me.
Looking forward to seeing you soon.
Sincerely
The mobile phone
The mobile phone has completely changed our lives. It is an instrument that I cannot imagine myself living without.
Apart from being in fashion, it is also a very helpful machine.
Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car, which wouldn't work?
What would you have done in that moment if you hadn't had a mobile phone?
You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you. Amazing, isn't it?
Nowadays, everyone has a mobile phone.
I am 15 years old, and everyone in my year has a mobile phone
Five years ago you wouldn't have even thought about it.
It has been a plus to me.
For example, now my parents allow me to go to more places just because I have my mobile phone with me, and sending text messages is an addiction that every teenager is obsessed with.
The invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am writing to inform you that I have received a letter from you about helping you to organize an international student conference in my college.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is not very far from my college.
However, due to the congestion and delays near the hotel, the best way to get from there to the conference is by underground to Victoria Station.
You will arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes
At the end of the conference party, you may either leave the party or stay in the college for more activities.
All different types of clothing could be worn, however, jeans and T-shirts would be common on that day.
Instead of staying in the hotel for the last three hours, I suggest that you could perhaps visit our town centre.
The popular attractions in our town, including the art gallery, museum, aquarium, and market square, could be found near our town's monument, the Saltisy Bridge.
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
Yours sincerely,
The Little Woods Shopping Mall
The location
The Little Woods shopping mall is an ideal place for you and your group to visit.
It is located very close to the town centre, next to the town museum.
It can be accessed by the nearby train station.
The facilities
For those students who are very interested in shopping, clothes shops, jewelry, stationery, bookshops, fashion, and beauty departments, and many more are available.
For those who want something more exciting and adventurous, you are recommended to visit the fun fair and amusements on the top floor of the building.
Other facilities, such as cinemas, theatres, and large department stores, could also be found.
There is a little souvenir shop for tourists, and there's a special discount for tourists from abroad that allows them to enter the car park.
In conclusion
Not only would the tourist information centre provide the information you might need, but you could also visit the ICT block, which allows you to access anything you want to know from the computers.
A special trip could also be organized.
Dear Marie,
I am writing in connection with your letter about the international student conference.
I'd be happy to help if I can
I would like to give you all the necessary details that can help you organize the conference.
Richard Brown booked the Palace Hotel for the students, which is very comfortable and close to our college.
You need only 5 minutes by walking to catch the college campus.
After the conference, we are planning to organize a big party with a barbecue.
The party will take place on a forest close to a camping area.
I hope we'll have a nice day.
Therefore, I suggest wearing some casual clothes.
On the last day, if you have some free time, I would recommend that you visit a very famous exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci.
The exposition will take place at 'Gribaldi Museum', which you can find on Cariden Street, Number 5.
You will never regret my suggestion.
If you need more information, let me know.
Best regards,
Report on the building at Berkeley Square
In order to prepare this report, I visited the business college and interviewed some students; I asked them only one question: 'Which building do you find more beautiful and more interesting in our city?'
The students, who were questioned, said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our city.
However, the majority of people point out that there is a very old building, which you can find at Berkeley Square.
Most students found this building very peculiar, because it reflects our history, tradition, and culture.
If you visit the building, you will get an impression, a feeling, that you are in past times.
This building attracts a lot of people because it has a very particular style with majestic and antique windows.
In addition, I also visited this place, and I was very impressed.
Finally, I would recommend that you visit Barkley Square.
In this area, you could also find other different buildings, which would attract your attention.
Report on the Group Leader
from
June 12, 2001
Dear Maria,
I've received your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you're going to organize very soon; here you have a little help for it.
At first, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you’re going to stay is “The Palace Hotel”, which is situated at the centre of the town.
It can't be difficult to find, because it's very near the conference.
Also, there is a bus provided for the organization's use to transport all the students to and from the hotel.
At the end of the conference, it will be a party.
I might suggest that you wear a casual dress, because many students feel relaxed after sitting and listening all day at the conference.
The party is amazed by a group of musicians, and as I remembered from last year, it was unforgettable, because all the people were dancing and having a lot of fun.
It's a well-situated town with a lot of museums to visit, especially the History Museum, which I visited last year. I think you can enjoy it as well.
It doesn't take a lot of time to visit, and the entrance is free.
Wishing I've been very helpful to you.
Yours sincerely,
The telephone can change our lives
It's impossible nowadays to think of a life without that invention, which quickly affects our lives, especially in business.
We can't imagine a big company without a phone, which makes business more quickly than anything else.
Also, I was asking too many people on the street.
Could you live without a telephone?
The answer was all the same 'Impossible'.
An old woman told me how important the phone was when her only son was abroad studying computers at the 'Chicago University'. She told me that every night I was expecting a call from my son; for me, it was the line to happiness.
However, it was one person whom he told me; it wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to write a lot, especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas. But now everyone phones him in an old-fashioned way.
In my opinion, this little 'box' that everyone has at home can save your life, especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation.
In conclusion, don't make very long phone calls, and you won't have to pay a very expensive bill
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter.
It's a shame that I won't see Richard because of his illness, but I'm willing to help you as much as I can.
Then I will give you some information that you asked for in your letter.
Firstly, about your accommodation, our college, to which I belong, offers visitors free accommodations with full facilities.
For example, bath, car park, free internet access, etc.
They are also located on our campus, so you can walk to the conference.
Secondly, as you know, we will have a party after the conference, which will take place at our student council hall with some meals.
This party is unlikely to be that formal, but I recommend you not wear jeans and trainers.
At last, if you have some free time, you'd better visit Kamakura City, which is just 30 minutes from our campus by train.
That is a very traditional Japanese city where many temples and heritage are situated.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe get familiar with our culture.
By the way, if you have any other questions, please send another letter.
Oh, Baby! I can't live without you!
These days, we've been surrounded by so many different kinds of products that our ancestors invented.
In our daily life, however, we seldom notice how much convenient life we've got; what's more, how much inconvenient our grandparents had it.
How nasty is that!
Let us try to appreciate their importance again.
As for me, the invention that is most important to me is a personal computer. I have been a full-time student at home, and our classes all require us to have a personal computer and use it at any time.
When you take the class on computer programming, you will definitely need one; it holds true for the class on politics, because you have to study statistics on your computer for doing social research and some analyses.
My professor said 'Go and get familiar with your computer. Otherwise, you'll fail.'
I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions that we usually use without any questions.
That's the nature of humanity
But I think it’s not only our fault, but the evidence of how much they integrate into our lives.
Dear Mrs. Smith
I received your letter requesting some information about the conference
I am glad to provide any information
The group has booked a place at the Hotel, which is near the train station.
It's really easy to reach the conference from the hotel
The bus is running in front of the hotel
If you catch the red bus, it will drop you off in front of the conference building.
In the conference, you should wear formal dress, but you are free to choose its colour or style.
At the end of the conference, there will be a reception at the hotel
We have arranged some tours in the city.
You will visit some interesting places and towers
I look forward to seeing you.
Yours faithfully.
Computer magic.
Can you imagine the life before computers.
Lots of books, papers, and many things are on the tables.
Computer is a really clever machine.
He stores all the information, never says enough, and it never forgets any information; whenever we want them from him, he doesn't refuse.
He saves time for humanity. People don't need to spend a lot of time recording everything; it makes space in offices.
Many bosses or those not employed in factories are not needed to employ many clever workers. We don't need them, so we don't hire as many.
This can save a lot of money for companies.
Computer has been helping to improve health because, in this century, we can use it in medical operations. Doctors can manage even the most extreme operations easily and confidently.
In general, computers have brought human life two centuries ahead. It makes life easier for us.
Dear Mrs. Smith
I am writing in reply to your letter, which I received yesterday.
Here is a piece of information that you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College, as well as some recommendations that might be useful for the students.
First of all, the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel, which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities.
This is a very central hotel, located not far from the conference centre.
You will be able to get there either by bus (not 150) or on foot.
Next, you're welcome to attend the party organized at the end of the conference.
It will begin around 11 p.m. and may last the whole night
People are going to be dressed discreetly there, and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant, multi-coloured clothing.
Finally, I think that you should jump at the opportunity to go to the historic Pergamon Museum before leaving.
Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exhibited there
I wish you a wonderful trip in advance, and I look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth.
Sincerely
To: The group leader
From
The subject is the Bournemouth National Museum
As requested, I visited the Bournemouth Natural History Museum, which, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting buildings in the area.
Below is a summary of the most important, relevant points, and some recommendations you may find useful.
Architecture.
The architecture of the building, in itself, is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation.
Even if the architectural style may seem a bit heavy, this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world
2. Exposition.
Although I have to admit that visiting the whole museum in one day is very tiring, it is such a rewarding and enriching experience that people never get tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures in each section of the museum.
3. The restaurant
The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable too
The waiters are friendly and always willing to offer advice.
In fact, it's just what visitors need after their trip through the museum
To sum up, I would say that this museum is more interesting than the others, because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant where you can have a rest if you need to.
Dear Ms. Smith,
In reply to your letter, I would like to answer your questions and provide you with more information.
Firstly, the hotel in which the group will stay is the Palace Hotel.
Secondly, the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus.
There is a bus stop in front of the hotel, and numbers 31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference.
Thirdly, the end-of-conference party would be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided.
Therefore, you could wear something quite casually.
Lastly, on the last day, I would suggest that you visit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Museum of Scotland, as both are very interesting and offer a student discount.
I hope this letter will help you with enough information
Yours sincerely,
Could modern people live without a light bulb?
Well, I don't think so.
Only those who could live without it must be extremely weird or someone in a very difficult situation.
We are nearly always surrounded by the man-made light.
With it, we read, study, walk, and so forth.
In the past, people relied on sunlight, moonlight, and the light from fires.
These were, however, very unreliable when the weather was bad, and when the fuel ran out.
They had to read, study, and walk in the dark.
Today, this kind of thing hardly happens!
Well, unless there wasn't anything wrong with the power supply.
I remember when I was about five, I visited a museum with my family.
While I was in the toilet, all the lights were turned off!
I screamed and cried since I had never experienced being in complete darkness before
When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb would be. And I was sure I could never, ever live without it.
Dear Maria,
First of all, I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill.
As the conference must go on, I will give you the information you asked for so that we can work on this conference.
According to the hotel, the group has been arranged to stay at a hotel that is very near the place where we will be having the conference.
The hotel is called The Palace Hotel.
It's just a 5-minute walk from there to the conference, and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference.
nan
The party will be in a friendly atmosphere; don't worry about what to wear.
There will be just our group; so dress however you like and let's enjoy ourselves.
Lastly, what you could possibly do while waiting for three hours is for some people who want to go shopping.
The shopping centre is just opposite the hotel. However, some people may want to simply wait at the hotel, having a cup of coffee.
The café in the hotel is available.
I hope that the information will be useful.
If you have any questions, I am more than happy to help.
I look forward to seeing you at the conference.
Sincerely yours
Could you live without this?
Imagine how your life would be if you woke up one morning and found that all the electricity was gone
How would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work?
How would you know what happens in the whole wide world, or even how you would get yourself breakfast without a toaster?
How would you cope with all those questions?
Thank goodness for those who had created the electricity and had applied it to every appliance.
Electricity is a clever invention
Everything is based on the use of electricity, for instance, from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system that stores priceless information.
Life wouldn't be easy if we didn't have electricity.
The electricity is very important to keeping our lives going
No matter where you are, what you do, apparently, you need the electricity.
Let's think this way: if we didn't have the electricity, there would be no other inventions at all.
I personally couldn't live without the electricity.
It has already had a great impact on my life
I watch the television and use the computer every day.
Moreover, other facilities in my house - such as telephone, air-conditioner, and fridge - need electricity. That's why it is very important to my life.
Dear Ms. Smith
My name is ..., I am a local student, and I will give you the requested information.
The rooms for your students have been booked at the Palace Hotel, near the city centre.
The hotel is just three bus stops away from our college.
So, you and your students can take the bus from the central bus station, which is right in front of your hotel, to get to the conference.
The end-of-conference party starts just one hour after the end of the conference
It is located in our sports hall.
There will be live music and a midnight dinner.
So you don’t have to appear very noble, dressed just as you like it (there’s no order – you may wear what you want).
For your last day, I think it would be interesting to visit our historical and famous city center.
I will organize a tourist guide that will provide us with information about the old buildings and sights
If you have any further questions, please write me a short letter.
Sincerely yours
The invention of the car was a pivotal moment in history.
From then on, people got mobile and had the possibility to travel wherever they wanted.
Of course, within the physical barriers.
People now have the chance to move to far-away places to spend their leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different from their home countryside.
In my life, the car has had an enormous influence. I come from a rural area.
The next city is 15 km away, and there is no acceptable bus or rail connection to get there.
It has been quite hard for me not to have the same opportunities for my free time as my friends who lived in or near the city.
I just had no possibility to meet them after school, because I didn't have a vehicle to get there.
I always needed either my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go
Today, I have my own car and I use it daily to get to work or to meet my friends at any place and at any time.
So, with my car, I achieved a great sense of freedom.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am applying to your letter as requested, regarding the conference at Peterborough Regional College.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is situated in the city center. It is about 15 minutes' walking distance from where the conference takes place.
In the next page, there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be held at the Regional College.
The conference will start at 7:00 p.m., the same day we expect; the 18th of June.
Our director will make a speech afterwards, and there will be a party with snacks, drinks, and music.
For those interested in it, there will also be an amusement karaoke.
Everybody should wear clothing that is at least a little formal.
No jeans and T-shirts.
There are many places you can visit in Peterborough
We have a cathedral that you can visit at any time; the riverside, which is the best option on a nice day when it's sunny and warm, is ideal for taking a walk.
For further details, look on the next page.
Yours sincerely,
Alice knew that it was going to be a very special day for her
She had a dream in which someone told her that that day would be special
So, she took the bus, like every morning, and she went to school.
But that day was a little different; she had her maths exam.
She had never passed a maths exam, and she was really nervous.
Half an hour before the exam, she went to the cafeteria to take a cup of tea.
She sat down and what a surprise it was that she found a lottery ticket
Nobody was around her; so she took the ticket.
After drinking her cup of tea, she went to the classroom where the exam took place.
She did the exam really well. She was very surprised. And after the exam, she went home.
She spent the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock.
At the time, she turned on the TV and while the lottery's man was shouting the winning numbers, she checked her own and what a surprise: the last four numbers were the same!
She won £500.
Dear Ms. Maria Smith,
I have just received a letter from you.
I am really appreciative of your interest in our conference.
Firstly, the Palace hotel is your accommodation that you have booked.
This is a very nice hotel, and I am sure you will be very pleased with staying there.
Secondly, you will have no problem finding the conference.
Obviously, using a taxi is the best; but unfortunately, it is quite expensive for students.
However, we have already prepared a mini-bus for you.
The bus will be in front of your hotel at 1 p.m., and it will take you to the conference.
Thirdly, we will have the end-of-conference party at 6 p.m. You can have dinner with wine, which is very famous in our area, and also enjoy the semi-classical concert that we have prepared for three months.
But I hope you will wear a formal suit and dress.
You will not be allowed to enter this party unless you wear casual clothing
Lastly, you don't have any problem spending your free time in Cambridge because we have a lot of attractions.
Cambridge bus tour, for example, will be a very nice time for you because it's the best and easiest way to know Cambridge.
But if you don't like it, you can enjoy a city-centre walking tour, and then you can enjoy going punting, which is the most pleasant attraction in Cambridge.
I hope you will be happy with our conference and party, and so on
We have been preparing all of them for a long time.
Please obligingly attend
If you want more information, please let me know.
Sincerely yours
Dear Mr. or Ms.
Welcome to my town; I am really grateful that you are visiting.
I would like you to visit the 'COEX' building, which is located in Samsung-dong, south of Seoul.
I will tell you some information about this building.
This building consists of a world exposition centre, a multiplex cinema, a huge shopping mall, a huge food court, and an aquarium.
Now, there is an exposition of the world's software for Linux being held at the exposition centre.
If you are interested in computers, it will give you big pleasures.
For a multiplex cinema, it is the largest cinema in Asia, with 18 screens.
Therefore, you can enjoy all the latest films there.
If you want to buy something, especially clothes, a shopping mall, which is called 'COEX Mall', will be the best place: very cheap and lots of designed clothes.
Also, you'd better not miss the food court.
It is providing all kinds of food.
Korean and Italian food – or, for that matter, you can enjoy them all.
Lastly, I really want you to go to the aquarium.
Actually, I have been there three times, but I still want to go back again.
I'm sure you'll like this very much.
I hope you'll enjoy yourself in my town. I would be very happy if you could be satisfied with my recommendation.
And if you need someone to guide you, please send me an email or give me a call.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully,
Dear Ms. Maria Smith,
Thank you for your letter,
I am writing to provide the information on the conference as requested
First of all, your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is very convenient to stay and has a beautiful landscape.
I would recommend that you get to the conference by subway, because the subway station is situated just a 5-minute walk from the hotel.
It will take you about 15 minutes to arrive at the college.
There will be a party after the conference.
We will serve you dinner. Some college students are going to sing, play musical instruments, and so on; however, you can join if you wish.
Therefore, you'd best wear casual and comfortable clothing.
Finally, this area has its reputation for shopping centers; therefore, it might be a good idea to buy some clothes, local food, and so on.
You will be able to buy them at a reasonable price.
I hope you'll enjoy your stay in my country
I look forward to meeting all of us
Sincerely yours
Amusement Centre
Introduction
The aim of this report is to provide information about the Amusement Centre in Seoul.
It is based on my experience and on the views expressed by local people who were interviewed.
The facilities
It was found that the Amusement Centre is the most popular building in Seoul to be enjoyed.
There is a wide range of facilities, including theatres, game centres, and Korean restaurants.
In particular, the people seemed to be satisfied with theaters, because the screen is massive.
The Korean restaurants appeared to be the most popular among foreigners
Things to Buy
It seems that you can buy everything you want at a reasonable price in the building.
Especially, Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap.
However, you can buy luxurious things as well, if you wish.
In conclusion
The Amusement Centre is a fascinating place, and it deserves a visit.
I would highly recommend this building, because not only can you enjoy yourself, but also experience Korean culture, which might be exotic to foreign visitors.
Dear Ms. Smith
Thank you very much for your letter, which I received yesterday.
I'm sure that, together, we can have a good student conference at my college.
I'll give you some useful information now
First of all, we come to some important points for the organization.
The group has been booked into a comfortable and well-situated hotel, whose name is the Palace Hotel
The hotel is on the right-hand side of the Parker Piece, which you can find on the map, that I will send to you.
The Palace Hotel is just 5 minutes' walk from the station.
The conference is situated in the building opposite the bus stop.
After a short speech from our director, the evening entertainment will begin.
In a well-known and enjoyable pub in the city centre, we consume the same food and drinks.
Furthermore, there will be a very famous live band.
You don't have to wear some special clothes.
You asked me for some suggestions for your free afternoons
Naturally, we have a lot of interesting things to visit, but something special is our cathedral.
The architecture brings you back into the old times, as well as the stained glass windows, which are really amazing.
We also have an interesting museum and a modern theatre.
Finally, I am sure you and your group will have spent some funny relaxing days.
Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information.
I look forward to seeing each other soon
Yours sincerely
Inventions have affected all our lives.
What do we use every day for many hours?
Sometimes, it's early in the morning until late in the evening.
Yes, it is the TV.
It is well known in almost all families, often with a lot of different channels.
First of all, the TV can tell us news quickly, and it shows us what has happened all over the world.
Another point in favour of the invention for the TV is that they're talking about interesting reports, for instance, about animals or different cultures from other countries.
Furthermore, they have a lot of different programmes; usually, there's something for everybody.
It could also be relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work.
Finally, the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information. You can watch the weather and all of it was present in wonderful color.
To sum up, in my opinion, the TV is a very good and useful invention.
However, they send a lot of violence that is not good for the children.
I cannot imagine living without television; it is something that we need for our education, for getting news and other helpful information.
Dear Ms. Smith,
Thank you for your letter.
 Surely I will try to help you as well as I can.
First, I'll tell you the name of the hotel: it's the Palace Hotel.
Fortunately, it's not far from our college.
To get from the hotel to the conference, you only need to take bus number 7 and get off at St. James' College, where the conference will take place.
About the end of conference I can only say that a band will play the whole night, and a special guest, whose identity I still don't know, will be expected.
I suggest wearing casual clothes; I think there's no need for school uniforms.
To answer your last question, I would propose that you attend the local zoo, because many baby animals were born in the past few days.
Dear Mrs. Smith, I hope the given information is useful to you.
I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
Sincerely yours
The telephone.
Could you imagine there's no telephone ringing in an office?
Or to live one's life without chatting for hours with your best friend?
Could you do something?
I can't
The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the late 19th century
It was an invention that nobody thought would be so important and widespread in the future.
Nowadays, almost every household in the Western world owns a telephone, and calling to relatives or friends scattered all over the world is no stranger thing.
People need the telephone not only for chatting, but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way, allowing them to answer immediately.
When I was a child, we had no telephone at home, and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village.
Now I have my own flat, and the first piece of furniture I've bought was the telephone. I'll never take it away from my home.
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
I want to inform you that I had already spoken with Richard Brown, who informed me about the conference.
Next week, I will start organizing some events for this conference.
The event will be organized at the Palace Hotel.
The same hotel where you'll stay
Palace Hotel is opposite the park called Clifton, which is near the college.
We chose that hotel because it's near the college, and we don't need to use a transport.
Because you know where the college is, you need to bring some things from the college to the hotel. I think it would be better for everyone to come with me to the college, and then we can all go together to the Palace Hotel.
The conference starts at 9:00 o'clock. You need to be at the college half an hour beforehand.
Regarding the end of the conference, I am thinking about some dance and singing events.
Tell me your idea.
About the clothes that we need to wear, must be uniform because it's the best conference in London, and every year, lectures come from other colleges.
Finally, on the last day, we have organized a sightseeing tour around London. You will have the opportunity to visit some museums and zoo parks.
I think it's a nice idea.
If you want more information, you can call me; my telephone number is 047***. Please, if you have more ideas, send me a letter.
Sincerely yours
Today, all the people have a telephone
The telephone is a part of our lives.
It is one of the most important investigations all over the world
The telephone is a type of communication
If you want to talk with your friends, parents, partner, or to ask something, you can call them without wondering how they can communicate with you.
Especially if some of your relatives or friends are living in another country, you can communicate with them every day and you don't feel that they're very far away from you.
With the development of technology, today's telephones have improved and their abilities.
They are phones that allow you to speak with multiple people on the same line.
Also, you can leave a message if you call and can't find someone.
The last type of telephone is the mobile phone.
You can use it everywhere and at any time
Finally, telephone apart from being a type of communication, is also a means of socialization.
Nowadays, those who are so busy don't have the time to see our friends. We can simply call them and catch up.
Especially the young people are using many hours on the telephone, and that is trouble for their parents.
The telephone is very important, but only if we can use it correctly and not as a form of entertainment, like many people are doing nowadays.
Dear Mrs. Smith
I have received your letter, which was about whether you would like me to inform you.
As you know, a hotel whose name is the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group.
The best way to get from there to the conference is to take a taxi.
I'm afraid there are no buses that can take you there.
We will have a great party at the end of the conference.
The party will be formal; therefore, you must wear formal clothes, such as a suit or a dress.
As you know, it is not suitable to wear jeans or something.
On your last day, you have an afternoon free.
In my area, there is a fantastic park, which is the most famous in the country.
You can find a lot of things to do or to see, or perhaps something else.
You can visit the zoo or walk around the amazing lake in the park.
I hope you will find all the details with which you would like to have in the letter.
If you need any information, please let me know.
Sincerely, Yours
Power of Computers
How much can a computer affect your life? I think it has a greater impact than you might think.
When I was a child, I always wanted to get the lyrics of the songs that I liked, but it was nearly impossible for me to have them.
I lacked them.
I first bought a computer when I was in university
It was essential for me because I wanted to become a computer programmer
That one time I met the magical world of computers
Linking to the internet was extremely popular.
The internet was something amazing for me.
Can you think that you have all the information you need whenever you want?
Can you think of contacting someone from any country whenever you want?
I meet a lot of people online and it really interests me
I learn a lot about their culture by reading or speaking with them online.
I wasn't able to imagine this before
In addition to this, today's companies cannot do anything without a computer.
Everything in this world will work with computers from now on
Computers have changed my lifestyle and my opinion about the world.
And they affect everyone's life directly or indirectly
Dear Mrs. M. Smith,
I am writing in order to reply to your letter and to provide all the information you requested
First of all, the hotel is the Palace Hotel, 82 Regent Street, so that it's very easy to reach the conference.
In fact, you can take the bus number three; as you can see, the bus stop is just in front of the hotel. Then, you can get off immediately after passing the church on your right-hand side.
Secondly, we will have the party in the hotel at 8:00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8:30 p.m. It would also be possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge. I would recommend that your students bring their Identity Card to prove their age.
What's more, I would suggest wearing very smart dress, and for men, it is obligatory to wear a tie.
Finally, if I were you, I would go shopping to the city centre to spend your remaining hours.
However, if you're interested in archaeology, you should visit the History Museum in Garden Square.
I hope you will find my letter interesting, and I look forward to seeing you.
Sincerely yours,
Have you ever thought about living without your car?
How can you manage your daily life without it?
For the last forty years, people seem to be completely addicted to using their own cars.
It is said that the majority of the citizens have got a car, and unfortunately, this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted.
On the other hand, this kind of facility has made our lives more comfortable and easy.
In fact, we can go everywhere, sitting either with friends or with our family, and carrying luggage and shopping bags.
Cars are able to cover not only short distances but also can be used for long journeys.
For example, in the past it would have been extremely exhausting traveling by horse, but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from.
However, I have to say that it has made people lazy and at the same time feel stressed due to the traffic.
On the other hand, one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money because cars have lasted long and allow us to travel quickly.
That's why I couldn't imagine my life without it
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
Thank you for your letter, which I received last week.
If a student is ill, we will return the money, but you should tell us until one week before we start.
And you are staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located in town center.
You can take buses, or your school buses.
It costs forty pence.
If you take public buses, it costs more expensive than a school bus.
The end-of-conference party is going to start at seven o'clock.
One of our teachers, who will be voted by the students, is making a speech for one hour.
After all, a student is making a speech about what they have learned. And then they will enjoy diner.
In my opinion, you should wear normal clothing.
I would like to suggest that you should visit the building with sixty-two floors, including a sixty-second floor.
There are eyeMAX cinemas, museums, and galleries.
This is very well known in our city.
I hope that my advice will help you or be helpful in some way.
I look forward to hearing from you soon
Sincerely yours
Busan Castle
Pusan Castle is located in South Korea.
This is the biggest and oldest in Pusan.
There are exhibited historical things, pictures, and clothes.
It was built four hundred years ago
When you go up to the top of the castle, you can see the whole town.
And there is a very big park in the castle.
Pusan Castle shows about Korean history from the time when one of our kings made our country.
Et al. and there are many facilities in Pusan Castle.
Restaurant
Shop specifically for groups.
They can be given a discount.
What's more, every place is explained in English.
So you don't need to pay it, but the entrance fee is a little expensive.
It costs ten pounds.
Fortunately, if someone visits a castle and there are more than ten people, they will give them a discount.
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith
With reference to your letter, which I received yesterday, I would like to give you some details about the International Student Conference; also, the accommodation and activities that are planned during this week.
The hotel that is booked for the students is one of the best in the area; it has great facilities, and it is situated near to the place where the conference will be.
From the hotel, the best way to get there is by bus; it's already booked for the next day you arrive at 8:30 am.
About the party, which is just at the end of the conference, a good idea would be to have a dance party, and the students don't really need to wear special clothes; it's just to have a little dance and meet all the students. After the party, there is a small trip to the old part of the city, and I think it would be a good choice to spend the last three hours that you have left before going back.
I hope this letter answers all your questions. If you want to know more about it, just give me a call or send me a letter.
Sincerely yours
The aim of this report is to provide some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings, which were built 10 years ago. It is one of the first buildings constructed using the latest technology and was designed by an important Mexican architect.
In addition, the resort has an interesting historical background about architecture and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico, for example. It provides different kinds of tours around Mexico.
On the contrary, it is far away from the city, and it has difficult transportation facilities.
In spite of the disadvantages, I would strongly recommend that students and the general public visit the new Acapulco resort buildings and have a great experience by learning about their history while also traveling around Mexico.
Dear Ms. Maria Smith,
I am afraid to hear that Mr. Brown is ill; I hope it won't be grave.
However, I will be glad to give you as much information as you need, and I hope you will find it helpful.
The name of the hotel in which the group is staying is the Palace Hotel. To get there, you must go to the centre of town; all buses go there. Once you're in the centre, the Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office.
For the end-of-conference party, we have booked one of the hotel's halls, and they will provide us with live music and catering.
Due to its elegance, the hotel is a place where I would suggest dressing up in evening attire.
Finally, to fill your free afternoon, I would hardly recommend visiting the cathedral and taking a walk around the old part of the city. If you like it, it will be my pleasure to show you the surroundings.
Yours sincerely,
Chairs are not only part of the furniture, they are also objects of decoration; and you can even find some in museums as art symbols.
Who could have invented something so useful?
In fact, nobody has gotten this clue, but it must have been the most clever person on earth.
The world is packed with so many types of chairs, from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others, finding a broad range of prices.
From my point of view, the chair is without a doubt the most useful gadget ever invented
Some people use them in their work. Others are wishing to get one by the end of the day, and for some other people, a wheel chair represents the possibility of movement.
Although it is worth saying that not everyone can choose his ideal chair, there is a special one for each of us.
Dear Ms. Smith,
Thank you for your letter.
I am glad to help you with the organisation of the conference
I phoned the tourist information last week, and I got some information about the accommodation of the students
I think we should book at the Palace hotel.
It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre.
The hotel is in a good position, just 10 minutes' walk from the conference. I think the best way to reach it is on foot.
I'm sure the students will enjoy walking around the town.
The conference starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon and finishes at 7:00 pm
I think they should wear smart dresses, because there will be lots of interesting people and important meetings.
In conclusion, for my final day, I thought it would be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art.
On the other hand, if you prefer to have a relaxing day, you could have a picnic in the wonderful park.
I hope my suggestions and ideas will help you to organize the meeting.
I look forward to receiving your confirmation.
Yours.
Report:
To: Mr.
From:
Date: June 21, 2000
Introduction:
As requested, the aim of this report is to assess the suitability for a group of American students for a visit to the Etruscan Museum.
General Information:
The museum is situated in the centre of Poppoliou, the picturesque fishing village on the Etruscan Coast.
Populonie is about 15 km from Piombino, and it can be reached by well-organized means of transportation.
Description:
The Etruscan Museum is one of the most attractive buildings in my town.
It contains many archaeological remains of the Etruscan civilization, including some found in their necropolis.
The entrance fee is £7 per student
Positive Aspects
The museum is well organized for tourists.
There are some shops, a café, and toilets.
Also, there are some free handheld phones that explain the history of the museum.
nan
After their visit to the museum, they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the Tuscan Archipelago, and they could have a picnic on the beach.
Negative Aspects
nan
The negative aspect of the museum is that it's quite expensive for students
Conclusion
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, I strongly recommend it for their excursion and their interests.
Dear Ms. Maria Smith,
I am writing to give you some information requested in your letter, which I received this morning.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London.
Personally, I am glad that you will have the opportunity to use its various facilities.
It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour's journey by underground from the conference.
In my opinion, the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Piccadilly line.
However, you would take bus number 150. If you would like to have a look at the city centre, you'd also have some free time.
Regarding the end of conference party, I would suggest wearing some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man, though it's not a formal occasion.
The party will finish quite late, so we've decided to provide a bus that will take you to the hotel safely.
Basically, during a three-hour period in the afternoon, nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places of London.
However, you would have a long walk along the river to take some essential photographs.
I look forward to welcoming you too.
Sincerely yours
Are you always happy when your telephone rings?
As far as I am concerned, the telephone was invented in the nineteenth century.
It has been affecting our lives very quickly, although there were some different ways of communication, such as TV, for instance.
Since the internet was introduced, many of us wouldn't have imagined life without it.
We were able to keep our own telephone in our pocket for some time.
However, are you always happy when your personal phone rings?
On the other hand, I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you wouldn't have your mobile switched on.
This invention has had a profound impact on my life.
Since I have been traveling around the world, I would have imagined being in touch with my family or friends without internet or my mobile phone.
In spite of having the opportunity to keep in touch with friends when we're far away from home, we should have been knowledgeable about how to use it without interrupting others.
Dear Maria,
Thank you for your letter.
I'll be a pleasure to help you.
The following provides some information about the international student conference
The party will take place in the Palace Hotel
The hotel is very close to Town Hall.
From Park Square, just go straight.
You can see the sign of the hotel
This is an international student party, so I suggest you wear traditional clothes.
It looks nice and has a good meaning.
You can notice that every student knows what they could make some traditional food for the party.
After meals, you can play some games and prepare a gift for the winner.
At the end of the conference, you can dance and sing together
Here's my suggestion about this party.
If you still have a problem, you can call me.
Love from whom?
Report on the building of LUTON University
I heard that a group of American students have just arrived in our town
I'd like to introduce an interesting building that they can visit.
It is the main building of Luton University at Park Square.
There is an academic building.
It includes a library
I would suggest that a suitable space for the GYM Club and a restaurant is an academic room.
There is a very big library.
You can find any information you want from it
At any other time, you can go to an IT suite and use the internet.
If you feel hungry, you don't need to go out.
Just across from the same building, you could find a restaurant.
I recommend this building to visit
Because American students will know how British students study and experience different campus life.
They can also talk with British students to communicate their study experiences
I think it will be interesting for American students.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am writing in response to your letter regarding the organization of an international student conference at Wimbledon Art College.
Below, I am clarifying some information that you asked about.
First of all, I would like to give you more information about the hotel's name and location.
The group has been booked into "Maria Luisa" hotel, which is situated in the center of Wimbledon, known as Wimbledon Village.
This hotel is immediately after Art College, so it will be easy for your group to find the place.
Secondly, turning to the end-of-conference party, it is planned to be held in Wimbledon Common, a nice piece of English nature.
So, it may be a good idea to wear some very comfortable and informal clothing.
Thirdly, when talking about your free afternoon before leaving the area, I would suggest that you visit the Wimbledon Museum of Tennis.
Where is good exposition, giving interesting information about the history of Wimbledon tennis tournaments.
I look forward to meeting you at our conference.
Yours sincerely.
The report.
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to give a brief description of the Academy of Art in St. Petersburg.
From my point of view, this building is the best option to visit.
Location:
This building is situated on the magnificent embankment of Niva River with an excellent view of the Hermitage Museum.
History.
The building was built by very famous Russian architects and is a magnificent example of Russian classical architecture of the 18th century.
The facilities:
In the Academy of Art, you can find the oldest art library with a wide range of books; the Museum of Russian Art, with a huge collection of paintings, sculptures, and architectural projects, from early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries.
It's also a good chance to be introduced to the Russian system of art education
Conclusion:
The Academy of Art building in St. Petersburg is worth visiting, both for its historical and educational aspects.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I have received your letter, which informs me that you are now in charge of the group of students attending the international conference.
It's my pleasure to help you with the information you need.
Your group has been booked into The Palace Hotel, located on the High Street, opposite the Post Office.
The conference will be held in The Royal Hall, and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus.
Take the 67 route, and it will take you just in front of the Royal Hall.
The end-of-conference party will be held in Francesco's Restaurant, just by The Royal Hall.
You should wear casual clothing
As for the free time you have, I would suggest visiting The Modern Art Museum, which now has a new exhibition.
Another suggestion could be to visit the zoo, or simply walk through the Spring Gardens, which are beautiful at this time of year.
I hope that all this information is helpful to you.
Yours sincerely.
The telephone: a great invention.
Imagine your life without a telephone.
Yes, I know. It's just hard to imagine our lives without this invention.
Think about the people who lived at the time it was invented
It must have been such an exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles away. And now, for us, it's just as simple as dialing a number and talking to whoever we want to.
Of course, it's nice to have a phone conversation with friends or family, but the telephone is also very important for both business and emergencies.
For example, I work for a bank, and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director, who lives 800 kilometres away; he doesn't have to come here, so we simply have a phone conference where everyone can talk, and that's it!
What about emergencies?
A timely phone call can save the lives of many people who are having a heart attack.
We sometimes don't realise the importance of some inventions that we use in our everyday life
But think about it, what would we do without them?
Dear Mrs. Maria.
I am one of all students, and I'm going to give you the information you need.
We've booked the hotel for you, and its name is 'Palace Hotel', which is quite near a shopping centre.
It's not far away; you just go along Park Road for about ten minutes.
Then you will arrive at the Palace Hotel on your left.
About the end of the conference party.
We're going to have dinner both before and after, and at that time, we'll bring you to the hotel. You'll need to wear a nightdress or suit and bow tie.
Finally, on the last day, you have three hours before you catch the plane, so we suggest that you can go to a shopping centre and buy something for your special person or visit a museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. It's up to you.
Yours sincerely
To the group leader
I am the student leader. We are grateful that your group has just arrived, so I am going to give you information about an interesting building to visit.
We recommend that you go to the BBC building.
First of all, the BBC's building is the news building of England.
On the ground floor, they have a video camera everywhere around the building, and police officers walk around the building as well.
Up to the first floor, they have a huge radio room for sending and receiving information all over the world because they have a small BBC building all over the world either.
For example, Thailand, the United States of America, Indonesia, and Canada.
And the second floor is the news room where they get on-air to show on television. That is not finished; I just gave you some information, but they have more interesting things you don't know.
I recommend visiting this building because it is the main one of London and it is the second most beautiful building in London, so that's why I recommend it.
From a student leader
Dear Ms. Smith,
Thank you very much for your letter.
I would be very pleased if I could help you answer all your enquiries.
The hotel in which your students' group has been booked is the Palace Hotel.
It's fairly easy to get there from the conference
I would suggest that you walk along New Street, which is the one next to the river, and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel on your right-hand side.
The hotel is just opposite the City Hospital
As you may already know, the end-of-conference party will take place at the main reception room in the same hotel.
You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening.
Answering your question, you should be fine about wearing casual clothes.
However, if you wish to dress smarter, there is no problem with that.
With reference to the last afternoon, if I were you, I would visit the City Museum.
There are many interesting works of art by famous painters from this country.
If you have any time left, you ought to go to the High Street, where you could go shopping.
Please, do not hesitate to contact me at the above address if you need any further information.
I look forward to meeting you at the conference.
Yours sincerely,
Inventions have affected all our lives!
The invention without a doubt, that has affected my own life by far is the car.
Cars have definitely changed all our lives, and I am not referring only in a positive way, but also in a negative way as well.
Picture this: a big city, such as London or New York, with no cars on the streets.
Could you imagine that?
To be honest, I can't
Cars are part of our daily life
Traffic jams can make people nervous, sometimes really upset or even violent.
However, people use cars.
If we don't use them, we suffer from them
In my case, I use public transport during the week to get to work, but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car.
I really need it to escape from pollution, mainly caused by cars and any other four-wheel-motored vehicles.
Isn't that contradictory?
To go to the countryside and being able to breathe fresh, nonpolluted air, I use my car, which, as far as I am concerned, does not help to maintain a clean environment at all.
Therefore, I am thinking of selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has accompanied me to all sorts of fantastic places, and will change my life for a new one: without a car.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I have just received your letter.
It was very sorry news for Richard Brown
I have provided much information about the international student conference
Firstly, the conference will take place in the Palace Hotel, and we will get there from our college by bus.
The number 45 bus runs to there every five minutes.
It takes about 25 minutes, which is convenient for us
Secondly, there are some programmes that are very great.
For the first time, the conference's head made a short speech, and then we had dinner and drinks.
Finally, we enjoy a disco party, so you should wear a suitable dress
On the last day, I'll go to your house, and then we'll think about our company's conference plane.
I hope it will be a successful conference.
See you soon.
Sincerely yours
Alice knew that it was going to be a very special day for her.
Alice and Jane came back to her home
Alice is Jane's boyfriend.
In the morning, they had met, and then they went to the beach
It was a nice day and a beautiful time.
In the evening, they were going to the disco party that was Jane's friends' birthday party.
Jane suddenly thought about her house key, which she had left inside her house. Meanwhile, Alice could see her house, and he found the bathroom window to be open.
So he climbed on the ladder up to the window and he opened the door; but policemen came there. 'What happened?'
Jane explained that situations and they understood him.
So, they could go to the disco party.
It was a very wonderful party, and they have never forgotten that day.
It was a very special day
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
I am writing to give you the information that you asked me for
The group has been booked into the Harris Hotel.
this hotel is very well placed
From there, you can get a taxi, catch buses seven and eleven, which both take you very close to the conference place, and also you can go by underground to get there.
The conference starts at 5:30 pm, and it finishes at 8:00 p.m.
Then, after the conference, there will be a formal party at the group's hotel, which starts at 9:00 PM and finishes at 12:00 AM.
this party is a formal one, so you should be casually dressed.
In this area, you could visit the Central Park.
It's a very beautiful and very good place to relax.
Another place that would be interesting to visit is the old city cathedral
I hope this information would be useful to you.
Yours Sincerely
Hampton Court Palace
Introduction:
I have been asked for information about an interesting building to visit
I went to Hampton Court last year, and I think it's a great place to visit.
Location:
Hampton Court Palace is located in Hampton Court.
In addition to that, I think this town is wonderful, and it has a magical beauty.
Transport:
To get to Hampton Court Palace, you need to take a train from Waterloo station.
From there, departures take place for trains to Hampton Court
Moreover, I think that by train is the best way to get there because Hampton Court train station is very close to Hampton Court Palace.
Price:
There is a great price for children, students, adults, and families.
They weigh between three and six pounds each.
Conclusion.
Hampton Court Palace is a building with a lot of history and many interesting things to see.
And also, it would be an excellent chance for this group of American students to see it.
To Mrs. Smith
Thank you for your letter, which arrived on Tuesday.
June
I am very pleased to help organize this conference at our college, which will be held at the Conference Centre at Bromley College, starting on the 20th of June for three days.
Please find the information you require as follows:
We have booked the hotel for the group.
Called 'Palace Hotel', which is about 10 miles away from our college, the hotel will have a coach to pick up the group from the airport on the nineteenth of June, and then take the group to the conference and return to the hotel every day.
Regarding the end of the conference party.
We've planned a barbecue at 5:00 pm on our most idyllic play field, which overlooks the endless countryside and farms.
At 7:00 p.m.
We can move to our student hall to have a disco dance until 10:00 pm.
On the last day, we have arranged a small party in the hotel. Then we will all set out to enjoy a sightseeing trip to Bromley town centre for about two hours before you depart for the airport.
Bromley town centre is the most beautiful shopping centre in south-east London.
There are many historical buildings that remain.
I think the students will enjoy this sight-seeing
If there's any further discussion, please let me know.
Yours sincerely,
How wonderful is light.
We need light both during the day and at night.
We need lamp lighting in offices, schools, or other places during the daytime.
How is life wonderful after a brilliant invention?
Here we just talk about the light that we invented, apart from natural light.
When I was small, we lived in a country yard. I remembered that we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipped into the oil in a small bottle and made it burn at the tip of the cotton string to give us light during nighttime. It was very little light, and many things we couldn't do under the oil lamps because the light range was very small.
There was no light outside our house, nor was there any light on the road or in the field.
I was always very scared whenever or wherever, because most places are.
Covered by darkness.
This scary night is still affecting my life now
I never stayed out after dark today except when accompanied by my family
What is the biggest person on earth, who invented the light, was Einstein.
He created another daytime after sunset. People use it to do whatever they want to do. We believe we can’t live without light today, especially in city life. We have a long time to spend on activities after the sun goes to bed.
Which we undoubtedly need light to keep on. I dare to say, without light, our life will go into a dark, dark hell.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am writing to you to reply to your question about the conference in London. Thank you for your letter.
I am very pleased to know that you decided to come to the 'II International Conference on Human Rights' which will be celebrated at Albert Hall College on the 25th of June.
I would like to inform you that the group to which you belong has been booked in the Palace Hotel, located in the centre of London, from 24th June until 26th June.
The Albert Hall College, the building where the conference will be held is situated near Green Park Avenue; so, to get there from the Palace Hotel, you can take bus number 26 or you can take the Piccadilly Line from South Kensington Station to Green Park Station.
It takes about 10 minutes.
Therefore, that is the fastest way of transportation you can choose.
The Conference will start at 9 am on 25 June, and will finish about 6 pm on that same day.
During the day is supposed to have a break of half an hour at 12 p.m, and finally, a party for all the people who will be there.
That will be a smart party, and because of this, it will require a well-dressed and immaculate presence.
Ladies should wear an evening dress, and gentlemen a dark suit.
As I can see from your letter, you will have about three hours before you catch your plane; so, I would suggest visiting the Tate Modern Museum, where you will find several interesting pictures, such as Dalí's Warhols.
If you need some more information or details about the conference, you can contact Alexia on +33 *** phone.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Introduction.
The aim of this report is to give some suggestions to a group of American students who have just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit.
Rome is a big city where they can find several important moments and buildings; therefore, I would suggest that they visit.
Fontana di Trevi is situated in Piazza Trevi in the centre of Rome.
That's a small square where there is a very big fountain.
It was built by Canova's architect in 1638
That is the fountain where the film 'Dolce Vita' was taken.
2) On the other hand, there is the Villa Borghese Building, which is a museum where one can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canova's and Bernini, who spent a long time working in Rome.
Conclusion
I would recommend the buildings because:
First of all, there are situated in the center of Rome, so they can take a bus to get around the city.
2) Secondly, they can enjoy visiting museums, and afterwards they can take something to eat or drink at the pizzerias and restaurants near these famous places.
In conclusion, they could combine art, history, and nighttime visits to one place without spending much money.
Dear Marie,
I am sorry to hear that our friend, Mr. Brown, is ill.
As our conference is due to start next week, I respond straight away.
There are some information you have asked me about.
We booked rooms for your group at the Palace Hotel.
That is the best option because it is located less than a 5-minute walk from the Conference Center.
When you stay at a hotel, you often have to turn right and then blow down the street.
At the first set of traffic lights, turn right again, and you should see a big blue building.
That's our conference center.
At the hotel reception, you will find printed information on how to get there.
As you know, at the end of the conference, there is a party
Party is scheduled to start at 8 p.m and run until 3 a.m. There will be a two-hour break between the end of the conference and the party.
At this time, you and your group can refresh yourselves.
I would like to mention that because our conference has a dress-code party.
I hope you will enjoy it.
We prepared some special attractions, including live dance music and a hot or cold buffet.
About whom or what are the last questions I can suggest to visit the Royal Castle?
That will give you and your guests an impression of our country and its history.
Sincerely
In our town, there are so many interesting places to see that it's hard to choose just one.
In my opinion, the most interesting one is the castle.
It is placed on a hill, making it very easy to recognize when.
Just look up, and you will see that huge building.
Actually, it is a whole complex: the Old and New Castle, Cathedral, and the most interesting underground part with its amazing crypts.
And if you climb to the top of the main tower, you will see an unforgettable view from a white town.
After that, you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle.
You will find there an amazing collection of old weapons, armour, and we are especially proud of it; the great collection of swords.
After that, I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurants located at the New Castle
I am sure that should be enough for one day's trip
For your information, I can say that at this time we have a five-week festival, and this night there will be a great display.
That should complete the amazing day.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter that arrived yesterday.
I do welcome you and your group, and I am willing to help you by providing the information that you have asked for.
Firstly, let me explain how to get from the Palace Hotel, where your group will be staying, to the conference.
The hotel is located in the center of Seoul; therefore, there are many ways to get to the conference.
The easiest way to get there is to take the underground, which takes about 20 minutes.
The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival.
Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held in the Palace Hotel's Pearl Room and starts at 6 o'clock in the evening.
Professor Kim from my college is going to give a speech, and after that, dinner will be served.
The party is not very formal, so you can wear any kind of dress as long as it is suitable for dinner.
Finally, I would like you to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace, Kyongbok, for the last day’s free time.
It must be a very interesting visit for the students who have never experienced an oriental atmosphere
It is just a five-minute walk from the hotel, and in front of the hotel's gate, an airport bus will be waiting for you to take you to the airport after finishing your outing.
I hope you will enjoy your stay in Korea, and do not hesitate to contact me for any further information.
I look forward to seeing you soon.
Sincerely yours

Report on Gyeongbok Palace – The Glory of the Chosŏn Kingdom
nan
The introduction.
This report provides information about Kyonggok Palace, which is highly recommended for visitors from foreign countries.
It highlights the background history and considers the interests of young people, and makes a final recommendation.
}
History.
The Kingdom of Chosun has a history that spans 500 years, and it lasted until the beginning of the 20th century.
Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family, so you will be able to imagine its size.
As the kings of Chosŏn loved being a part of nature, the palace had a large garden; however, it was destroyed by the army of Japan, and now there remain only a few remnants of the original palace.
There is a special monument to the last queen of Chosŏn, who was killed by the Japanese army.
There isn't anything more that I would rather do than to spend all day writing.
Activity
The reason that this palace is also popular with youngsters is that they tend to dislike the historical visit, which would be due to the various activities.
You can try the traditional games of Korea, and there's a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the royals.
Also, there are performances that are held daily at the front gate of the palace.
?
Here is my final recommendation.
It goes without saying that you should visit the Kyong Bok Palace if you want to learn about Korean history.
You will find many interesting points there. Therefore, I urge you to visit the place, if you want to experience the tradition of Korea.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am writing in response to your letter, where you asked me to provide more information about the international student conference and offer some ideas and suggestions on what you and your students can do during your free time here.
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located in the central area of the city. So, it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be held.
The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 (the bus stop is opposite the hotel), or we can hire a minibus for you, but there is an extra charge for that.
There is a party on the last day of the conference.
Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best.
Fewer people from the party are likely to attend ours like a nightclub, where lots of music, dancing, and fun are provided.
Please note that the alcoholic drinks are only sold until 11 p.m.
You can wear whatever you like to this kind of party
Coming back to ideas and suggestions I've promised to give you about a free afternoon, before you catch your plane, I can advise you to visit our zoo or take a picnic in a park, before you will go to the night party.
Yours sincerely
Can you see how many inventions surround you in your life?
Such simple and usual things like a telephone, a car, and a computer, so only seem to be normal and usual for us, or we've got used to them, as we use them every day.
One hundred years before, people couldn't even use an electric lamp, not to mention a car or computer.
They have had a significant impact on our lives since they arrived, but not everyone believes it's really the case.
Some people say that many of the most important inventions in our life are not as good and useful as we have got used to seeing them.
First of all, they say that environment pollution is caused by cars and other vehicles, as well as excessive use of electricity for electric equipment and other reasons.
But to my opinion, if people's inventions take their rightful place in our lives, they are right then.
I think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it makes you able to get in touch with anyone, regardless of where you are. I am talking about mobile phones, which now have a majority of our choice.
Computers make everything much faster, so everything is now based on computer systems.
An electric lamp was an important invention one hundred years before, but for that time it was like a revolution.
I think it wouldn't be possible to survive for us without an electric life
Because of shipbuilding developments, people could make all the geographical discoveries, and an automobile transport is undeniable necessity in our lives.
In any event, I am more likely to believe that the benefits of people's inventions far outweigh their disadvantages.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I have just read your letter, and I am happy to help by providing some further information.
According to your first question, the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel for the time of the conference, where a reservation has already been made.
It is situated near our college, about a five-minute walk from the nearest tube station, which is South Wimbledon.
As you were informed, there will be a party for all attendees of the conference, which will take place afterwards at the hotel's restaurant.
Considering the fact that it will be an entirely sociable meeting, I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event.
Finally, answering your last question about students' days out, I suggest visiting a local lawn tennis museum and Wimbledon tennis courts; as it is one of the best international tourist attractions.
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
I look forward to seeing you.
Yours sincerely,
To: Leader of the group of American students

Dear Mrs. Maria Smith
I am replying to your letter because of the help you are in need of.
I am pleased to tell you what information you need for the group
The hotel I had booked is the Palace Hotel, which is located in the centre of London, just two blocks from Victoria Station.
I think it's very convenient for the group. You know, the Victoria area is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city. About the hotel, I'll say, it's a good value and has nice services; the rooms are decent and each one has its own bathroom, which is sufficient for the number of students we get. And the best way to get to the College for the Conference is by walking to Victoria station, getting the tram to Gloucester Road, and then taking three buses to the left-hand corner, where you'll find the College.
However, I am going to make a plan for each student with all the detail and address.
About the party at the end of the conference, we organize it in the same hotel which has a nice salon.
Will be good for your group; you don't need to move to another place.
We'll have drinks and food and music for dancing
It is not a formal party, so I think it's fine to wear something not too formal
I want to suggest some ideas for the last day: you and your group might go to Green Park and visit the Queen's House and Parliament. This area is very nice, and after the conference, fresh air or another option could be The new Telegraph Gallery – I've never been there, but it could be a good excuse to visit with you.
I have been hearing about the avenue they have in exhibition is interesting
I hope you found this letter useful, and if you have any questions, please let me know.
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
Your sincerely
Inventions have affected our lives
The computer was invented about thirty years ago, and initially processed information with a big card that was performed and made a small hole. And each hole meant something like a code.
The machine was used to read this card, which was too big; you would usually need a room for our computer.
I remember when I had a particularly unfair lesson at university, and the teacher took us to the computer center. And I saw those machines for the first time, and my colleagues were laughing; it was very difficult to imagine how you can work with such types of computers.
In these days, the computer is part of one's own life; you use it all the time. Sometimes, you do something or another. It's just what you need to like go to the bank, use public transport, go shopping, etc. It's a machine that makes life easy and allows you to carry it everywhere. Isn't it amazing? The way the computer changes means programs are now more quick, useful, and practical.
But the computer has a bad seed to me wanting means we live each day more and more because of it.
So, I feel assured when I think about the consequences if some of the virus or malicious people make bad use of happenings in this day and age with regard to sex or other issues.
I work with children and the computer helps my job affect me too.
So, I hope that World makes sense about and the engineer in computer works have not established these problems because some good could be something very dangerous.
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
Thank you for your letter.
I am writing to offer you some advice on an international student conference.
First of all, the name of the palace hotel that we have been booked into is Palace Hotel.
And we have two choices to get to the conference: a bus or a train.
Both of them are as convenient as getting there
The day before we leave, we have a party that takes place in our hotel.
It's a kind of formal party, so we should be well dressed.
I suggest that you wear a formal dress.
There are some finger foods and drinks.
It might be a great party at the end of the conference.
In my opinion, at the end of all, we could go to the center of town because there are many places to take a look and do some shopping.
It's quite a nice and suitable place to spend for three hours
It could be interesting for them to.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely.
Imagine our lives without a telephone.
If a telephone hadn't been invented, we wouldn't have lived perfectly like nowadays.
Wouldn't you think we rely on it more than we expect?
A telephone is used when we need to contact someone, and also in emergency situations or for accessing the internet.
It has various ways to use; however, nowadays it is not only used for that purpose, but also it keeps our company.
Even if you feel alone, you can easily talk to or hear from your friend.
Then that makes you happy.
A long time ago, people lived without this perfect invention.
However?
They used to keep in touch with someone by letter.
In spite of taking a lot of time to catch up with, it was the only way.
So that's why they have invented a telephone.
Now we could feel the world getting closer and closer because of a telephone.
Who wouldn't thank anyone for this great invention?
Dear Madam,
I received your letter and I'm pleased to answer your questions.
M. Brown has booked rooms at the Palace Hotel.
This is a first-class hotel.
The easiest way from the hotel to the conference centre is by bus.
There is a bus stop in front of your hotel.
Take the bus to downtown
After four stops, get off the bus.
The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus'. 
If you leave the bus, the conference is in the house opposite the road.
You can’t miss it.
Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant, and then we will go to a disco.
For the disco, you mustn't wear blue jeans.
Finally, at your last day, I propose that you do a sightseeing tour of our town
It takes about two hours.
After that, you'll have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland
If you have any more questions, write back to me.
Yours sincerely,
I will write about the invention of the computer.
With the computer, our work is easier and more interesting.
Before the advent of computers, people had to write each letter by hand.
When they needed to correct a word, they had to rewrite the whole letter.
With the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word, or change the name without rewriting the whole letter again. We save the letter and in three weeks we could send it to another person.
I work at a bank and spend all day working with computers
If we hadn't already done one, we had to write all the transactions on paper.
If I order money online for our bank using the computer, I can be sure that I will arrive the next day.
But if I had to write a letter and send it by post, the money will arrive two or three days later.
I have never worked without a computer, but if we hadn't any, we would find it normally.
Mrs. Maria Smith,
I'm pleased to be able to help with the international student conference.
The hotel in which the group has booked is the Palace hotel, which is situated near the Big Bridge of Mont Blanc.
To get from the hotel to the conference, you have to take the highway direction of Lausanne, and after nearly half an hour of driving, you come out at the place which is indicated by Coppet and Divonne.
When you come out, just go straight ahead on your right, and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school.
The end-of-conference party will take place at the same location.
Some musicians will play classical music, and there will be many different drinks and foods.
You should wear some formal clothes, but not necessarily really pretty ones.
For three hours, you could visit the Museum of the Red Cross, which is very interesting.
I hope that this information will help you
Sincerely, yours
The portable phone, a very useful invention.
Throughout all of human history, there were individuals who tried to make human life better, but it was in the last century that there were the most significant discoveries made.
When the phone without cable was invented, one wasn't sure whether it would be a success or not.
But the research went on, and the portable phone is getting increasingly smaller and more useful.
The portable phone is an important invention because nearly everybody has one, and so one can always call someone if there is a problem.
Moreover, some portable phones have a connection to the web, so it is easy to read newspapers if one does not have enough money to buy one.
Personally, the portable phone has affected my own life because when someone is phoning at home, I don't have to rush to take the phone, being afraid it's too late.
I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still do not have a portable phone.
Dear Maria,
I would be pleased to help you with all your questions, and I will provide you with the information you need as much as I can
I would like to inform you that the Central Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accommodation of the group, and it will be quite easy to get everywhere from the hotel on foot during your stay.
As you know that we are arranging an evening party on the third day of the week, we can say that it's a kind of relaxation time.
Nothing will be spatial.
The place is the college garden
It is 7 o'clock.
There is no need to bother about clothes.
Everyone can put on something casual
Before leaving from England, I suggest you visit the canals and small villages around Basingstoke. You could find the opportunity to see rural life.
Sincerely yours,
Time flies
I have to admit that whoever invented the cars and transportation vehicles made the most respectable invention in the world.
I say that it must be the most important thing for us, because they help us make the most of our time, which is passing so quickly.
Can you deny how quickly we can get somewhere by car or by bus
Perhaps it's 10 times as quick to get somewhere by car.
Try to imagine your life without having any of them.
Wouldn't be unbearable and painful.
Certainly it would be just like mine
Because I live in a rural area, far from any village, town, or city centre.
The nearest civilization is an hour's walk away.
I have no car; there is no local bus service to use.
Even coming to Basingstoke seems like an international journey to me
And of course this stops me every time from living a social life.
However, I am aware that time flies for me. I must do whatever I want before it's too late.
And I must confess that the invention of the car was the most useful invention for humanity.
Dear Ms. Maria Smith,
I was delighted to receive your letter and to learn that a group of students from your college has decided to participate in our international student conference
As you need more information, I answer all your questions with pleasure.
Firstly, the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group.
It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college; so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot.
Secondly, our end-of-conference party includes included dinner and dancing; I would advise you to wear something not very formal.
Finally, you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places (castles, built in the 13th century) or art gallery, as well as beautiful Bodnant Garden.
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and discussing our mutual work during the conference
Sincerely yours
There are many different people's inventions around us.
We're so used to them that sometimes we think they've always existed
Some of them are very practical, others are rather strange.
I think that one of the most important and influential aspects of our lives is the telephone.
Imagine life without phones.
As you're on the road, you've had a car accident.
What are you going to do without your phone ?
In another situation, your son is ill; he needs help urgently.
I am sure that the phone has saved many lives
Besides, it's always very nice to ring your friend or mother at any time.
Thanks to the phone, it is possible that even your mom is on the other end of the Earth.
To be honest, the next great invention of people, computers, can't work properly, if you haven't got a phone.
So I am very grateful to the man, who invented it, unfortunately, I have forgotten his name.
It always happens with people, doesn't that?
Try to ask who invented the will or the book.
Chêne-Bourg, Tuesday, 12th of June
Dear Mrs. Smith,
it is with great regret that I hear of Mr. Brown's illness, and I hope to see him soon in excellent health.
Nevertheless, I am both pleased and honourable to expect you and your group in the context of our international meeting.
We have made arrangements for your stay at the Palace Hotel.
Furthermore, since it is located between the airport and our location, a bus shuttle has been organized to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room.
The end-of-conference party is to be held at the 'Royal Room' of the hotel, which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and solemnity.
Therefore, all guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothing in order to be accepted.
As for the three hours of free time, I strongly suggest that you check in your luggage at the airport and then, after a five-minute bus ride, spend your time in the marvellous 'Old City'.
Best regards
My Fair Mobile Phone
The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout the last years.
The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is, of course, the mobile phone.
It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has become a necessary condition in some professional activities.
Trades, politicians, and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs.
However, the common man seems to ignore just how important and useful a mobile phone becomes when it's in the hands of a high school student.
It becomes then a real obsession for the average students, as they use it before the lessons, during the lessons, during lunch, and especially during examinations.
Nevertheless, it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam, since its major role is actually to allow students and their parents to discuss during each day's courses.
The bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student's phone, but his or her parents'!
Dear Ms. Smith,
I have just received your letter and I am writing to you as soon as possible
I can promise you that I will do my best to help you.
You told me that you are the leader of a group of students this year because Mr. Brown is ill.
Poor Mr. Brown, I hope he will get better soon.
As I've just checked, the group has been booked into The Palace Hotel.
The best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, which I have arranged for you.
The driver, Mr. Olsson, has worked for us since
He will pick you up at 11:00 a.m. The conference is from 12:00 to 2:00 p.m. At the end of the conference, there is a party from 2:00 to 3:00.
I suggest you wear comfortable and nice clothes because I have planned a sightseeing tour for you before your plane at 8:00 p.m. I'd like to show you a museum, a gallery, and the gardens that belong to the palace.
Then we can have a rest at the café and talk before your flight home.
I think I gave you all important information
I hope to see you all soon.
Yours sincerely.
Today motorization is one of the most important inventions.
As you look around, everybody has a car or motorcycle
No matter that people have started to worry more about pollution in the world.
Let me tell you how the invention of the motorcycle has affected my life.
I love motorcycles and I don’t think I could live without them.
I have been driving a motorcycle since I was 16 years old.
My brother and I used to go to the rock concerts.
We've met a lot of people who are just as mad about motorcycles as we are.
We were avenging racing events and trips.
We were driving motorcycles a few days before we finally got to meeting points.
I really enjoy driving motorcycle
People say it's dangerous; I don't think so.
When I'm driving, it's just me and my motorcycle.
Between me and my friends are those that I like and trust
And around me, I can watch and enjoy the nature while we shop for camping.
We can go to any place we like, avoid traffic and crowded buses, trains, etc.
I am really grateful for people who invented the first motorcycle in the world.
I feel very bad about not knowing who it was.
On the other hand, no matter what, I feel very good about that because that invention has changed and affected my life, including people I care about; it has affected my life in the very best way.
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
Thank you very much for your letter.
As you asked me in your letter, I am very happy to help you find out more about the conference.
The hotel where your group will be staying is the Palace Hotel
It's reasonably near the college, so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along the River Thames, following yellow signs on sunny days.
If it rains, you can take bus 54 that stops in front of the college.
The end-of-conference party is designed to give a sense of many different cultures.
So, you will enjoy traditional foods, music, dances, and games from all over the world.
As part of this, the leader of each group has to wear a costume from her country.
Other members of groups can wear formal dresses that are normal and pretty.
On the last day, I recommend that you visit the place that is located at the centre of our city.
It is approximately 1,000 years old; therefore, I am sure that you will find it fascinating to see it.
Sincerely yours,
Can you imagine your life without a single computer?
Well, I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a desert.
If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them, it must be clear that the invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all of our lives.
For example, all infrastructures such as transport and power stations are run using computers; the government uses them to organize all sorts of things in a country, and all kinds of services and businesses, such as hospitals and supermarkets, use them as essential capital.
In other words, almost all aspects of our lives today rely heavily on computers.
So, I am sure that it's convincing enough to say that the invention of computers is really important.
From my personal experience, I can also say that a personal computer is an amazing tool.
It improves the productivity of my homework, which is often essay writing, and also allows me to access the internet.
Since I live abroad, the internet is really useful for me to keep in touch with my best friend and to stay informed about what's going on in my home country.
To sum up, I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers that has affected both individuals and a society as a whole.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am writing in response to your inquiry about this year's international conference.
The conference will be held at the Palace Hotel on Old Street
There will be signs to follow from Central Station.
The conference is commencing on 31st July 2001 from 10:00 to 3:00
A light lunch will be provided.
After the conference, there will be a relaxing party.
There is no dress code for the party
However, I suggest that you could wear the same outfit that you wear to the conference.
I have included the local map; there are some ideas at the back of it.
Please let me know if you would like to book one of our city-walk tours; we have arranged special discounts for conference attendees.
Personally, I recommend the Dickens' tour because it is a good length of walking and very historic.
I hope that I have covered all the information you would need, and I look forward to seeing you.
Sincerely
P.S., please find the enclosed map.
There are several interesting buildings in London.
I believe Liverpool Street Station is at the top of the list.
The building itself looks grand and elegant.
Despite the fact that this building has served half a million commuters daily, it is always clean and functional.
There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting to build.
The newly decorated section is fairly modern in style, with escalators and touch-screen ticket machines.
It is also very well linked to the old underground station, which provides a stark contrast in terms of transformation.
The old bit is rather unique and charming.
You could really imagine what it was like in the old days.
There is another surprising section within this building.
At the far back of the station is also connected to a spacious, well-designed pedestrian park.
It is a good example of great architecture that was designed to serve the public.
Finally, it is in the heart of the city, and everyone would be able to find it without a doubt.
June 12, 2001
Dear Mrs. Smith
Thank you for your letter, dated 8 June 2001.
I hope I can give you the information you need.
So the conference will be a great experience for you and your group
Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel.
The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station.
A free shuttle bus gets you to the conference center.
The bus leaves at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel.
The end-of-conference party is playing in a rented green ground.
There will be a barbecue, a place to dance, and many more.
It is a surprise!
I suggest wearing leisurely clothing to the party.
The last afternoon, you could go on a city tour, visit the Museum of Fine Arts, or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the common park.
I hope I can give you some ideas. I look forward to seeing you.
Sincerely yours
What would life be like without a phone?
Have you ever thought about a world without phones?
How was life in the 18th century when there was no opportunity to communicate by phone, and how would it be now?
I cannot imagine how our life would be.
We are living in a busy world.
In the business world, you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients, to make appointments, and to order articles; then, time is money!
How has the phone affected my own life? I think that's a good question to think about. I couldn't call my friends from another city and just say 'hello'.
It would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment.
So, what did the phone revolution do for us?
That saves time.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am writing in reply to your letter, in which you asked me for help.
I hope I will be able to provide the information you need for the group of students who are attending the conference.
Firstly, the Palace Hotel is waiting for you and your students.
The best way to get from there to the college, where the conference will take place, is simply to walk.
Actually, the college is situated 500 metres away from the hotel
As you know, the conference will be followed by a party.
It will begin at 7 p.m. and will last until late in the evening.
You don't need to worry about what you should wear to this event.
In fact, the purpose of the end-of-conference party is to relax after a busy day. Therefore, you and your students can wear jeans and sports shoes.
To conclude, we decided to organize a guided tour by coach; as you have an afternoon free before your plane takes off.
I hope the international student conference will help us get to know each other better, and I'm confident it will be a success.
Yours sincerely.
Dear Sir or Madam:
I am writing in reply to your letter, in which you asked me for information about an interesting building to visit.
There are so many places of interest in Lausanne, but I think that the Olympic Museum is the most notable for the following reasons.
The Olympic Museum dates back to the 19th century and is the largest in Europe.
It has shown all the different sportsmen have been doing since the first Olympic Games in Greece.
You can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes have been made to improve them gradually.
You can admire every kind of equipment you need to do any particular sport.
You will be informed about the story of sport in general, and about the new technologies that are used nowadays in high competitions.
The museum is near the city centre and is accessible by bus or on foot.
It will take you an afternoon to visit it, and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor, well-known for being one of the best establishments in Lausanne.
I hope my recommendations will help you in choosing a building to visit.
Yours faithfully,
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am writing in response to the letter we have received from you, in order to let you know all the information you have asked for.
First of all, your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, Main Road 21, which is situated not far from our college.
I'd suggest that you walk; it will only take you about seven minutes.
Just follow the Main Road until you reach a junction, where you turn right and then walk along Denmore Avenue
The college is a huge, yellow building. You can't miss it.
Secondly, you have required information about the end of conference party.
It will begin at 6:00 p.m. and last until midnight.
All the students will be provided with sacks, and we have managed to book a band as well.
The location of the party isn’t fixed yet, but we will let you know after your arrival.
There's no need to put on special clothes for the party; casual ones can do just fine, as we want everyone to feel comfortable.
Last but not least, I will give you some ideas on where to spend your free afternoon.
I'd suggest that you visit our local museum, as there's a marvellous exhibition there at the moment.
Provided the weather is fine, you could also go swimming or take a tour through our beautiful town.
(I could book a guide for you if you are interested)
Please write back or call me if there's any more information you need.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, and I wish you all the best.
Yours sincerely
The telephone is a blessing.
Who among you could imagine life without the telephone?
Not able to call your friend, I wonder if I can just pop in for a moment.
Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day.
It's first intention was to listen to a concert, but only if you weren't able to attend in person
Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system, and no one could imagine life without it.
Take me, for example. I use it whenever there's a problem and I need some advice, or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason.
I cannot always walk up to the person and say 'Sorry, I must cancel our meeting', because then it's too late anyway, isn't it?
Life definitely wouldn't be the same without the invention of the telephone.
We use it daily, either to get information or to pass it on
Just try to spend one week without using a telephone, and you'll see that it's impossible to do so.
So don't take the telephone for granted, but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I would like to thank you for your letter.
I am sorry to learn that Richard Brown cannot attend the conference
Please transmit to him my best wishes for his recovery
We have booked rooms for all members of your group at the Palace Hotel.
It is a very cozy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building, approximately one mile away.
There is a direct bus link between the two locations: this is bus line number six; the bus station for the conference building is called 'Avenue de Cour' and the one at the Palace Hotel is named 'Main Station'.
As for the party, we don't have a casual dressing code.
Students usually wear dark clothes, with a tie for the boys, and a mid-length skirt or dress, for the girls.
There are many activities you can do during your free afternoons.
I would like to suggest visiting the 'Ethnographic Museum', which is kind of unique in the world.
Looking forward to meeting you soon.
I remain yours sincerely.
The car.
I think that the car is one of the most influential human inventions that has had the greatest impact on the way of life of people in industrialized countries.
Nowadays, more than a percentage of the world's industry is related to the automotive business: car manufacturing, gasoline extracting and refining, tyre recycling, and so on.
The industrial countries have undergone a profound evolution in their regulations since cars have become widely available.
At the beginning of the last century, only a few very rich people could afford a car; it was considered kind of a leisure activity or a sport to drive one.
Today, almost everyone owns a car and needs it for their daily activities.
The transport network has changed according to this social evolution.
The increasing number of cars and infrastructure are now creating problems.
A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded, and environmental issues are increasingly related to the intensive use of cars and lorries.
People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without impacting their mobility 
This will be a tough challenge for the new century.
Dear Ms. Smith,
My name is Juniper. I am helping to organize the conference at the college.
I received your letter the other day, and I am writing to answer all your questions.
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held.
You can take the No. 41 bus from the hotel to the conference; it only takes approximately ten minutes.
As for the end-of-conference party, it will be on the morning of the last day, starting at 9:00.
All the students and staff will join together in the hall
They can play games and talk about their personal experiences.
The main aim is to deepen the friendship among all these pupils, coming from all over the world.
So it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smartly.
I have made arrangements for the afternoon on the last day for your benefit.
If you are free, I will show you around our college
You can visit our newly built science lab as well
I'm sure you would acquire a lot of knowledge there.
I'm looking forward to meeting you.
Best wishes
The best choice
Welcome to London.
You asked me to visit an interesting building
In my opinion, I'll recommend the British Museum.
One of the reasons is that you can learn almost everything about British history there.
The museum looks very old compared with some other buildings in London, but it is very modern inside.
After going through the enormous main entrance, you can see a huge white round building, which is a library.
A lot of famous people have been to this library before.
The British Hall is on the first floor, not far from the library.
It shows a large number of valuable items.
Almost everyone tells you a story or shows you a picture about British history.
I'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful lesson.
Apart from national history, there is also more content about the past of the world.
You can go to many sections such as Asia Hall, Egypt Hall, Europe Hall, and so forth.
Countless fascinating things will definitively take up the whole day to appreciate
After a visit to the British Museum, you'll be able to put your history textbook away.
Additionally, you don't have to pay anything for it; and the transport is extremely convenient, so the British Museum is your best choice. Don't hesitate any longer.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am writing to give you the information about the conference.
The hotel that your group has been booked into is called the Palace Hotel
It's simple to find your way from this hotel to the conference
You only need to cross the street in front of your hotel.
There you will find a modern building with two different doors: a red one and a blue one.
You are asked to take the blue door.
After entering, you will see the signed conference room.
We organized an end-of-conference party on the day before your departure
Everyone is welcome to join this party to get to know one another in a good atmosphere.
You should wear nice and comfortable clothing.
This is an informal party.
I suggest you visit the old part of Zurich, or go to the zoo, before your departure.
I am looking forward to meeting you at the conference.
If there is any question remaining, please contact me.
Yours sincerely.
The most important invention
I love baking cakes, cookies, and bread.
Baking is a passion, and in the town where I live, I'm known for making the best cakes in the area.
It doesn’t matter what kind of mood I’m in; I can do it all the time, and it makes me feel good.
But I couldn't bake without an oven
I'm so grateful for this invention that allows me to live my passion
I think that the oven is one of the most important inventions.
If there's someone who doesn't agree with me, they should try to live one month without using the oven.
Besides, they should look carefully into what they buy.
I'm positive that, after such an experience, everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lives.
I'm thanking the person who invented the oven.
Thank you.
Dear Mrs. Smith,
I am writing in reply to your letter.
I am sorry about Richard Brown.
And I understand that you need help; so, I will help you as far as I can.
Firstly, the hotel which has been booked for you is the Palace Hotel, located close to the conference.
In order to get from the hotel to the conference, you just need to take the bus we will be offering.
Secondly, the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6:00 p.m., which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference.
The party is arranged as a casual affair, therefore, you can wear comfortable clothing. You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well.
Finally, if you want to have an exciting experience here, I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals.
As you may hear, our city is well known for its musicals.
Alternatively, if you want to relax, you can take a walk in the park, which is situated about ten minutes' walk from the hotel.
Whatever you choose, you will be satisfied with your choice.
If you have more questions about the conference or something else, do not hesitate to ask me. I would be glad to help you.
Sincerely yours,
Some inventions are not regarded as great things, even though life without them cannot be imagined.
People no longer have the same impression about important inventions, as they have become increasingly popular and common.
However, there is something that is still believed to be an extremely important invention.
This is electricity invented by Thomas Edison
From my point of view, the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most machines, appliances, and equipment used in modern times can be operated with only electricity, which makes people not have to do too much physical labor.
What's more, many inventions have been accelerated by electricity.
In my life, I use electricity in many different ways.
At night, I can study because of it. And also, it saves my time, which would otherwise be used for doing housework, such as laundry, cleaning rooms, and ironing.
It makes my life much more convenient than it would be without it.
To sum up, although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention anymore, the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not change.

Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
I am very glad to help you with the International Student Conference
I hope that our friend Richard Brown doesn't have any serious illnesses.
Where is the conference referent?
This will be located at the Casino Hotel, and we don't need to worry about finding it because all the main routes in Devonport have signs indicating the correct route to the popular hotel.
After finishing the conference, there is a party at the same hotel
In this party, there are some foods, soft drinks, music, and a special place for dancing.
This party is for the students, so the kinds of clothes won't be so formal.
One day before we're supposed to catch our plane.
We could choose two options for spending our free time.
One is a guided tour of Centre City, and another is visiting the chocolate factory.
Please, if you have any more questions, please call me at 387-55-9880.
Sincerely yours,
I can live without this.
It's true
In our lives, maybe, couldn't be without electricity.
Some people can live without this, but I am sure that the world would be very different.
When we are using different equipment in our houses, we are using electricity.
Small things are very important in our lives
For example: Television, computer, just light, and a long list that I can no longer write.
I don't like thinking, my house is of my life, without all these facilities.
In winter, when it's very dark early, and afterward, I need to spend my free time at home.
What I can do without is my music and my computer.
Now, just think about whether you'd do the same thing if you were in a city with a car, airplanes, and shops, but no lights.
Finally, I think that everyone knows that electricity is very important to invent and for me it's the best.
Dear Ms. Smith,
Thank you for your last letter. I am sorry for not having provided enough information.
We have already booked a four-star hotel, Palace Hotel, which is near the River Thames, in Walton-on-Thames.
It's not far from the station, so we'll go there by train.
The end-of-conference party will be held in an Indian restaurant, which is next to the hotel.
It is supposed to be held from 7 pm to 11 pm.
Also, there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner. Disco is also provided.
You can wear anything you like. We would like you to be just yourself and have fun.
As you know, our area is quite famous, and many people come to visit it every year.
There are so many things to do, unfortunately, there is only three hours.
I recommend the high street, located in the centre of our area, because it is quite good for shopping.
So you can buy gifts for your friends and family.
I hope I have given you enough information, and if you still have some doubts, please do not hesitate to contact us.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
Nowadays, our lives are becoming better and better.
Lots of great inventions have been invented in order to make people live comfortably
If you ask me, which is the greatest invention of all time? I'll say that it's the television.
Television is just an amazing invention. My good friend said that. I agree with her.
Firstly, televisions help us learn more about the world without needing to travel everywhere.
If there are no televisions, we won't know what the other countries are like, or even what language they speak, unless we go to that country.
Secondly, however, for some points, it can educate young children.
Many TV programs are especially made for children, such as 'Learn to Follow Me' and 'Be Good to Others'.
Actually, they are quite good programs, and they helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child.
The last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainment.
Maybe you will think that playing basketball, going to cinemas and discos are much better than staying at home, sitting in front of the television.
However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't
If sometimes I don't want to go out and I don't want to feel lonely, that's easy - just turn on the television and enjoy myself.
However, everything has its advantages and disadvantage.
Personally, I do think that television is the most important inventions.
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
I received your letter this morning, and I am very pleased to provide you with some information.
As I know, he booked the Palace Hotel in Downtown
When you go to the conference, you can take either a bus or a taxi.
But if you have enough time, I would like to recommend walking.
Because there are a lot of beautiful trees, and you can see the sea.
It takes just fifteen minutes.
I think that everybody can enjoy it.
By the way, the end-of-conference party is a kind of farewell party.
There will be three parts.
The first part, the chairman and a few guests will have a speech. The second part, the participants will evaluate themselves. And the last part, it will provide dinner and drinks.
It will be a not-too-formal party.
So you can wear whatever you like.
Moreover, I would like to recommend a city tour lasting three hours.
Everybody can enjoy themselves.
It is £12 each, and there is a reduction for groups.
I hope it will be a good tip for you. If you have any problems, you can contact me at any time.
And I hope you have a nice time in my town; please also extend my regards to Richard.
Yours sincerely.
Nowadays, there are many inventions around the world, and they make us more comfortable and convenient.
Moreover, we cannot live without them
For example, electricity, computer, telephone, boat, and car (wheel), etc.
None of them is unimportant to us
But I think that the invention of electricity is the most important one among them
If you look around at home, there are many electric devices.
Electricity is capable of being used to invent other things
It also gave us even more free time, especially for women.
It has absolutely reduced women's working hours
Even more, we can enjoy our night with lights
If we want to do something, we can do it at night just like during the day.
Finally, the quality of our life has been changed by electricity
It could reduce our working time and make our work more enjoyable.
It is also advancing increasingly.
It will give us a better future.
Have you ever imagined that you would drive an electric car?
December 12, 2001
Dear Ms. Maria Smith,
Thank you for your letter about the international student's conference
Here are the answers to your questions.
You will stay at the Palace Hotel, which is situated in front of the railway station in Camberley.
To get to the conference, you catch Coach No.7 from the station and get off at the Camberley College bus stop.
It takes only 5 minutes from the station.
When you arrive, just turn to your left, and you'll find the stadium where the conference will be held.
The end-of-conference party will be held at the college's cafeteria, which is next to the stadium.
It starts at 6:00 p.m. and ends at 10:00 p.m.
We will prepare traditional English meals, and some students from a foreign country will prepare their ethnic foods.
There is a museum next to the Camberley station, which has a good collection of paintings and ceramics; and it would be a good place for you to spend your free time.
Instead, there are a lot of shops around there; you can buy souvenirs.
I am looking forward to meeting you.
Yours sincerely.
To: A student from the United States
From: Julie
The aim of this report is to describe the Haunted Castle, located in Camberley.
The place
This castle is situated at the center of the town and surrounded by woods.
Inside the castle is always dark, even during the daytime.
The story.
It is 500 years old, and it is said to be haunted by a lady's ghost.
She appears occasionally and opens every window in the castle
It is believed that she was a nanny who worked there, but unfortunately fell out of the window.
People said she was seeking something, and still seeking, even if she had died for 500 years.
In conclusion
The ghost story may not be true, but it has good furniture from the 16th century, and the castle itself is very beautiful.
I think it's worth seeing
I hope you'll enjoy visiting there.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I have received your letter this morning
I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attend the conference; I am glad that you are able to lead the group.
I hope that this information is very useful to you, during your attempt at the conference.
I have booked a hotel that is not far from our school.
The hotel is called the Epsom Down Hotel
Your plane will arrive in England by 9:00 AM
There will be a coach waiting for you, and the driver will be next to the information desk.
You should arrive at the hotel by 11:00.
You will then have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage
The conference will start on time at 12:30. So, I would suggest that you leave the hotel by 12:00.
The best way to get to the conference is to follow along the college road and turn left towards the end. Then, keep going straight; you will eventually see the main entrance of the college.
When you get into college, you can just ask any boys on campus where to go next.
They all know where the conference is and when
At the end of the conference, we will have a party.
The party aims to help all the students get to know each other better
The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room.
I will suggest they wear formal clothing, as in a tie, trousers, and jacket.
For the afternoon's free time on the last day
There are many different options that they can choose
They can play tennis, do athletics, swim, and participate in many other sports events in our school if they want to.
Or they can also visit the town of Epsom
There are shops that sell clothes, food, and books. They can decide what they want to do; it's entirely up to them.
I am looking forward to seeing you, and I hope you have a safe flight over to England.
Sincerely,
Dear Group Leader,
Welcome to Taiwan.
This report is based on an interesting building, where you can take a tour for your students to visit.
This building is situated in Taipei, the capital.
The building is called Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.
Nearly everyone knows where this building is; therefore, if you have a chance, just ask the local people in Taipei about this building.
The memorial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds.
As you go into the main hall, you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kai-shek; this is because the building is the remembrance of how well Chiang did in history.
The statue is about 20 feet high.
Next to the statue, it is protected by the guards; they will change every four hours.
Apart from the main hall, there are also lots of other galleries.
In these galleries, there are historical paintings and antique furnishings that Chiang Kai-shek used.
These treasures are very old, even older than the history of America.
All these treasures were brought over to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek during China's defeat
They have all been well looked after.
As well as all the treasures, statues and historical paintings
There are also restaurants and modern galleries.
When you are tired after looking around, you might want to buy drinks or something to eat. Alternatively, if you're fed up with historical things, you may as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things that are more modern.
Finally, if you went to visit this building, I will recommend you to stay at a hotel not far from the memorial Hall, called Hyatt Hotel.
It takes only about five minutes if you walk
I hope you will all have a great time in Taiwan, and I hope you will enjoy the buildings.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I have received your letter, dated the 12th of June 2001
I am very happy to help you, and I hope that the information that I am going to give you will be enough.
The international student conference will take place at the Palace Hotel in Lausanne
The hotel is a big building in the middle of the town, near the Place Saint-François.
And the name of the street is "Grand Chêne".
You cannot miss it.
After the conference, we are going to stay at the Palace Hotel, but instead of staying in the conference room, we are going to move to the reception room, where a dinner will be prepared for us.
Afterwards, a live band is going to play the rest of the night.
For the clothes, you have to wear something that's both smart and classic.
If you want to stay in Lausanne during your afternoons free, the best thing to do is to go to Ouchy.
There, you can enjoy the landscape and have a sunbath.
Sincerely,
Olympique Museum
The aim of this report is to provide further information on an interesting building to visit in Lausanne
It is based on my own experiences
Why is the Olympic Museum?
The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offers, for tourists, an unbelievable view of the mountains and the lake.
But also, the museum has a lot of gardens with several statues.
Besides, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern.
First of all, the main interest of the museum is the Olympic history.
You can find a lot of documentaries about it, and you have several personal competitors' objects.
In addition, you can play with several interactive games and learn about the rules of the Olympic Games.
Reasons for recommendation.
The main reason is the lowest price
You pay only to FRS for the entry, and you can stay as long as you want.
On the other hand, if you are more than ten people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 francs per person.
It seems that this is the best way to visit this museum.
Conclusion
To sum up, the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place, and it could be a good trip with your family or student group.
Therefore, if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games, it must be the best place for that.
Dear Maria,
I'm so happy to help you at this international student conference
I'm afraid for Richard.
Could you please convey my best wishes for his health?
I'm sure you can perfectly replace it and lead your group.
At first, you should know that you're booked into the Palace Hotel, which is one of the best in town.
Access to the conference place is very easy
First of all, you must walk down to Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop. Then, you take bus number two, which goes directly to the college.
After the conference, there is a great party organized by friends.
It starts at 20:00 until the end of the night, so be ready!
There is no special theme for the wearing style, but it should be more fun if you wear something crazy.
Finally, I propose that you go to the new college pool on the last afternoon of the day.
Everyone will go there.
I hope you will have a fun time.
Sincerely yours
Hello,
I will give you some information on the Yverdon Castle.
This building is one of the oldest remaining in the landscape of the town
I think it's important to see it when you come there because it shows us how the town has been developed around it since its creation
Those days, the castle is being remade; so, there are a lot of construction engines around it.
That's not a big problem, because there is a complete museum within it, where you can see old pictures of the castle throughout the centuries.
There are a lot of old items that were in the king's family.
You should have probably heard about the mummy who has been sleeping there for about two thousand years. You can see it in the dungeon.
So, you can visit anywhere you want, with or without a guide.
I hope you will enjoy the visit, and I wish you a nice holiday in Yverdon.
Best regards,
Dear Mrs. Smith,
Thank you for your letter.
I will try my best to answer the questions.
First of all, we have already booked the five-star hotel for your group.
It's a modern hotel, near our college, and it's also very convenient to come from the airport. You can take either by bus or taxi.
The number 101 bus starts from the airport, then you can get off at the 'City College' stop.
It would be a great chance to take part in the party, for everyone
This is just a relaxing party, intended just for our members to have a chance to relax and make friends.
So, I think you'd better wear a dress.
Finally, about those free three hours, I personally prefer to go shopping.
Our city has the biggest shopping centre in South England; it gathers so many shops.
It's worth spending time and money on that.
I look forward to seeing you.
Sincerely yours
Today's people have become accustomed to watching television's programs every day.
The TV is so important that you can see it in every household, and it's an essential piece of equipment for everyone.
First of all, in my opinion, TV has great educational functions, and it also makes the world seem smaller.
You can just sit at home, and then you'll know what's happening all over the world at the moment.
I would rather watch the news on TV than read it in a newspaper or hear it on the radio, because the news on TV is vivid.
Moreover, the TV is a great company for people who live alone or feel alone. I would like to watch TV when I'm staying at home.
Some people are talking, laughing, and crying over there. So, join them; you will feel much better than just by yourself.
Some TV programs are enjoyable!
However, TV also has some disadvantages.
You might just be sitting in front of the TV for hours learning nothing, or not speaking with your family.
I think this is the worst influence in society
Inclusion, the TV has both advantages and disadvantages, but on the whole, advantages are greater than disadvantages
So, but overall, TV remains a wonderful and important invention in the world.
Dear Ms. Smith,
I am writing to give you more information about an international student conference.
The group has been booked into the King Hotel, which is very easy to find.
And the best way to get from there to the conference is by following the road in front of the hotel to the right, then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side.
After that walk, go to the right about 15 metres, and you will find the conference place, which is called the White House.
At the end of the conference, we are going to have an international dinner as well as some shows from the students at my college.
As this is a special conference, you are welcome to wear your own national dress when presenting on behalf of your country.
Finally, on the last day, you can spend your free time visiting our town hall, where you'll be able to learn more about my area or do some shopping at High Street.
If you want more information, please contact me, and I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
Sincerely yours,
Dear Mr. Bill,
I am writing to provide some information about a very interesting building to visit.
It is called Penrhyn Castle; as the building will tell you all about Wales.
On the positive side, you and the group will be able to learn more about Welsh artworks which are presented on the walls, on the doors, and some furniture.
The building itself looks splendid and beautifully.
On the other hand, you might find something that is very boring, such as walking along an old wooden floor that causes some noise.
And some old toilets might look awful
But, in my opinion, I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building.
Because they will be able to learn and compare with the places in their own country.
As Wales is not modern in the same way as America, so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to old things
Yours sincerely,
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith,
I was really pleased to receive your letter.
Unfortunately, Richard Brown is ill, but I can help you as much as I can.
So, I'm writing to reply and give all the information you asked for.
Firstly, we have booked the Palace Hotel, which is located in central London.
The best way to get from the hotel to the conference is to use the tube because it takes only 20 minutes.
The tube has two lines, one of which is red.
And your speech would be better for the end of the conference party
I'd suggest that you wear at least semi-formal attire, such as a jacket with other clothes.
Finally, I'd like to suggest that you could spend about three hours at the national museum in my area.
The museum can be helpful in understanding our country's history and art.
I look forward to seeing you soon.
Sincerely yours,
The computer is the most important invention in our lives.
Some people might say that the electricity is more important than another thing.
It's hard to say which is the most important invention.
However, I'd say that a computer is more amazing an invention than are another inventions such as the telephone or the car.
Recently, computers are really necessary, and we can't manage to work without them.
Not only is business important, but so too is it in my life.
For instance, when I want to contact my friend, it's quite helpful by using email.
Before computers had been invented, we couldn't possibly have had lots of information easily, and we couldn't contact foreign countries at the same time.
It's time to create a new system that makes it easier and more straightforward for many more people to enjoy computers even more than they do now.
Despite an amazing invention, some times computers make big problems, such as the millennium bug (also known as the 'Y2K' problem), because computers are not as flexible as a human brain.
However, computers are worthwhile to use in our lives until even more convenient machines will be invented
Dear Mrs. Smith,
Thank you for your letter.
I am very pleased to give you the requested information.
We are holding the conference party at the Royal Lancaster Hotel's banqueting room at 2:00 pm on Saturday.
24 June
The nearest tube station is Lancaster Gate.
As you know, we have been working very hard all this term.
So we've decided that at the end of the conference party, we will have both a buffet and a disco.
Our students then will get to know each other well.
I would suggest that everyone wear casual dresses.
Finally, I would recommend that you and your group enjoy shopping and sightseeing around Oxford Street and the nearby area.
I look forward to seeing you and your group soon
Sincerely yours
To the group leader
From
Re: The Barbican Centre
As you requested, which is the most interesting building to visit, I would strongly recommend the Barbican Centre building in the city.
It is located in the city and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station.
The Barbican Centre was built in 1976.
Apart from banks and important offices.
There are also a world stock market exchange, an opera theatre, shopping arcades, bookstores and record stores.
It also holds an international exhibition all year round
Recently, the exhibition on Africa has just finished.
The opening time starts at 7:30 a.m. and continues till late at night, when the theatre is closed.
The building is huge, equipped with high technology, modern construction, and tight security
It upgrades the building every year.
The Barbican Centre is a very important building in London.
You and your group will visit a building that has many places within it.
So that you can spend your time all at once
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter, which arrived this morning.
Of course it is a pity that Mr. Brown has been ill, but we are happy that you are coming now.
You asked me which hotel the group had booked
It is the Palace Hotel, about a mile away, where the conference will take place.
The best way to get there is to take the bus, number 7.
The bus stop is opposite the hotel's entrance.
You will leave the bus at Royal Gardens.
Turn left and go straight to Baker Street. At the end of this street, there is house number 18.
This is our college.
You wish to know all about the end-of-conference party.
As far as I can see, there will be only a little dinner, and a group of young singers will surprise us with their songs
Moreover, you asked what to wear. Don't bother.
I would recommend that you wear some casual clothes, such as a pair of jeans, a blouse, or a skirt and a jacket.
Don't forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because you won't have a chance to change them.
Finally, I'd like to offer you some advice on what you can do for about three hours.
Firstly, we have a nice and interesting museum; it is located near the hotel.
Furthermore, there is the zoo with a lot of different animals, located just a five-minute walk away.
Lastly, there is also a very old and famous church, with many colored windows.
For further information, please call me. I hope you will find the conference here to be interesting.
I am looking forward to seeing you
Sincerely yours
The telephone is a very important invention
In my early childhood, my mother told me that when she was a little girl, there was only one telephone in the house where she had lived.
It has been in her parents' apartment.
The neighbours had come in to make their phone calls and then got their phone calls
Today, nobody could imagine such a situation.
In every household, there is a telephone at least.
There are many advantages to it
Firstly, people are able to talk to a person at any time. Be it just for fun, or also to discuss some important and relevant things.
Moreover, we can always call for help to the police, to the hospital, or to a doctor.
This could potentially save a life!
Another advantage is that all offices, firms, and industries could not further exist without it
Of course, there is also a significant disadvantage.
All people know this situation; people often don't want to be interrupted, maybe they're reading a book, having a good talk, or even taking a little sleep... then the telephone rings!
It's not an easy decision on how to react now
Being sincere, most of us would go to the telephone.
Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing everywhere, and at every time.
Especially, youngsters tend to misuse this kind of invention.
To sum up, this invention is one of the most useful things.
It's always the same whether people use it or not, and how they handle it.
Dear Mrs. Maria Smith
Thank you for your letter; which arrived yesterday.
I hope to give you all the information needed, and please; if you want more information or something is not clear, please don’t hesitate to contact me again.
The hotel is near the station and is called 'Grand Plaza'.
When you arrived, you take the train to Guildford. After that, you'll find it just across the road, in front of the station.
It's very comfortable hotel where you can find everything you need
From there, you need to take bus number 50, which stops near the hotel and arrives in town centre.
The conference is held in the civic hall, making it very easy to find.
At the end of the conference, there is a party - a perfect opportunity for your students to meet new friends from all parts of the world and they could speak about their experiences.
I suggest wearing something very comfortable but elegant to that conference. The organization wants all boys to wear a jacket; the tie is not necessary.
I don't really know what you can see, but I think it's not enough; near the station, however, there's a beautiful garden that's popular for its variety of flowers.
If I found something special to visit in three hours, I'll call you.
Sincerely yours
Dear Sir or Madam
It's very nice of you to come and visit my town.
In that area, there are a lot of things you can see, and some interesting buildings to visit.
The best building to see is the cathedral
It is the most important church in that area for its architecture.
It's something very particular, its pavement made from many small pieces of wood, its windows with many colors, it is fantastic.
It was built on top of the hill, and around there is only a huge field.
You can arrive here walking because the bus stop is just at the bottom of the hill.
But really, you must see it; the position of the cathedral gives you something special—a big tranquility.
I hope you like it.
I look forward to hearing from you
best regards
Dear Maria,
I hope that all the information you need will be answered satisfactorily.
First of all, you have been booked at the Palace Hotel.
Secondly, the best way to go from the hotel to the conference center is to use one of the shuttle buses we provide at this effect.
They are going to leave at 9 o'clock.
Concerning the end-of-conference party
It's going to take place in the same hotel, the Palace Hotel; we suggest casual dressing for this special event.
Finally, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but I suggest you visit the Caldea centre, which is a very special bath centre.
If you need further information, do not hesitate to contact us
Sincerely yours
Dear John
In your previous letter, you asked for information about interesting buildings to visit in my country.
There are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
The churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of their different Romanic styles.
I suggest you visit first the cathedral of Le Seu Saint-Martial, because it is the most emblematic building in the area.
If you are interested in more modern buildings, I can suggest you visit "Caldea", which is a very modern bath centre with beautiful architecture.
Finally, if none of my suggestions fit with your expectations, let me know more about what kind of buildings you are interested in and I'll do all my best to find something more suitable.
Best regards.
June 12, 2001
Dear Ms. Smith,
In response to your letter, I will try to offer some advice.
Concerning the hotel, the group has been booked at the Palace Hotel.
The conference will take place not far from the hotel, so you'll see indications to follow.
For the conference, I suggest you wear a beautiful dress, because there will be important people from other colleges.
At the end of the conference, all students and leaders will have a drink.
To finish, if you have some spare time, you could walk in the centre of Poitiers, which is very beautiful.
I hope that I give you enough details.
I look forward to meeting you at the conference.
Sincerely
The building, commonly referred to as 'Le Centre Pompidou' in French, is a very surprising monument.
It's a modern building with an architecture that you can't see in other places
What is impressive about this building is the large number of tubes that you can see both outside and inside it.
On the Pompidou centre, there are different exhibitions on different themes.
In general, there are paintings, video, and sculpture.
These exhibitions are often very attractive and they change every year.
Another good point is that, if you go there, you'll have an extraordinary view of the city.
So if you visit Paris, the Pompidou Centre is a very interesting building to visit, even if in Paris there are many other buildings.
Dear Ms. Smith.
I am writing in response to your letter to provide you with some further information about the international student conference at our college.
I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel.
It is situated in the centre of our town and it takes only five minutes to get to the college, where the conference will be held.
I think that the best choice for you is to take the 234 bus.
The bus stop where you should get off is called 'The Green Man'.
With reference to the end-of-conference party, which is taking place on Tuesday from 8:00 pm until midnight, I would like to mention the necessary dress code.
It is an evening dress for women, and black trousers; a white shirt, and a black bow tie, for men.
Lastly, I would like to give you some suggestions about the way in which you can spend your free time in our town.
I am strongly convinced that you should visit the local science museum.
Additionally, there is a very good shopping centre next to the museum.
I look forward to seeing you at the conference, and I hope you will have a good time in our town.
Sincerely yours
As it is widely known, lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century. Nevertheless, I believe that the most important one is the computer.
It is a fact that modern society has created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information.
Taking it into consideration, I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for accountants, designers, engineers, and so forth.
Another point in its favour is the possibility of connecting to the internet.
It allows you to have all the necessary information on your fingertips.
Also, not least importantly, is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages
For instance, a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world, which computers create.
Another drawback is that in industry, computers replace people's labour, which leads to an increase in unemployment.
To conclude, I would like to say that the governments of all developed countries wouldn't have been so concerned about so-called 'Problem 2000' if the computer had not been so important for modern society.
Neuchâtel, 12 June 2001
Dear Ms. Smith,
I thank you for your recent letter.
First, I would like to congratulate you on your new responsibility, as a result of Mr. Brown's illness.
I am happy to provide you with all the details you need
Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located directly in front of the bus station.
To get to the conference from your hotel is really easy.
You have to take the bus, number 1, and get off at 'Black House,' which is the third stop.
After the conference, at about 8 p.m., a party is organized.
During the event, everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers at the conference.
Food and beverages will be available.
After the cocktail, the band 'Zero One' is playing their famous songs.
The clothes required for the party are suits for men and cocktail dresses for women.
Before your departure, you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to take a sightseeing tour in our city.
I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city, and look forward to meeting you at this conference.
Yours faithfully.
Report on the 'Paintings' Museum
In order to write this report, I spent hours at this wonderful museum.
There, I saw the exhibitions and admired the building itself.
I walked around the garden too.
The location
The museum is located in Œuy, in front of the 'Delamuraz Hotel'.
It is close to the main road, and it is only 300 meters from the station.
Outside.
The building is made of white stone.
It has two floors.
Before going inside, you have to pass through the huge garden.
There are ponds, pools, trees, flowers, and ducks that can be admired.
I recommend that you take your swimsuit, because in the summer, it is allowed to swim in pools.
Inside.
When you're inside the museum, you'll be impressed by the paintings on the walls.
There were many nurses painting during the war.
If you go down a few steps, you will discover the ceiling.
Everything in this room is about wine
To learn about the whole history of the building, there is a room dedicated to that on the first floor.
I particularly recommend that you visit the 'blue' room.
Everything in this room is blue: the carpet, the ceiling, and even the door.
According to the owner, it was a room where people would go in the past when they were depressed.
In conclusion
To sum up, I would like to add that this house is the most famous one in our city.
You should come and visit it for the paintings, or for the building itself
You won't be disappointed.
The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit both the house and the garden.
